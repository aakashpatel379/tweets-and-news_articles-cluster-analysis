<TITLE>IF DOLLAR FOLLOWS WALL STREET JAPANESE WILL DIVEST</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yoshiko Mori</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street,
Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a
serious way, Japan investment managers say.
    The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar
securities, have already sold U.S. Equities.
    But ""if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen
yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw
significant funds from U.S. Shares,"" said Akira Kawakami, deputy
manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's
international investment department.
    An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese
investment in U.S. Bonds. ""Japan-U.S. Interest rate
differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing
in the absence of dollar stability,"" said Kawakami.
    U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture
following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.
Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect
should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.
    But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating
to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was
holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning.
    ""Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in
New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to
lighten their U.S. Stock inventories,"" Hiromitsu Sunada, manager
of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment
department said.
    Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points
to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.
    ""Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult,
considering the dangers,"" said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general
manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed
income securities marketing group.
    Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once
markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers
said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one
or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.
The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for
the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said.
    ""The basic background which has supported the stocks and
bonds markets has not changed,"" said Norio Okutsu, assistant
general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department. ""But new
outflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing.""  However,
this was already evident three months ago, he said.

<TITLE>MONSANTO &lt;MTC> NUTRASWEET SALES SHOW SMALL DROP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ST. LOUIS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Monsanto Co said sales of its
Nutrasweet artificial sweetener fell slightly in the third
quarter due to a continuing decline in usage by the powdered
soft drink market.
    ""It doesn't look as if there is going to be any improvement
in the powdered soft drink sector,"" said Donna Smith, a
Monsanto spokeswoman.
    The company reported third quarter sales of 1.90 billion
dlrs from 1.69 billion a year earlier. Nutrasweet sales fell to
177 mln from 179 mln a year earlier, it said.
    A growing market for diet sodas, about 90 pct of which use
Nutrasweet, offset much of the sales loss, said Monsanto chief
economist Nick Filippello.
    Prospects remain strong in the diet soda market, Filippello
said, since industry analysts predict diet carbonated soft
drinks will hold about 28 pct of the soda market by year's end,
up from 25 pct in 1986.
    That market, coupled with increased usage of Nutrasweet in
such items as frozen desserts, should result in a 10 pct
increase in consumer consumption of the sweetener in 1987,
Filippello said.
    Monsanto spokeswoman Donna Smith refused to comment on the
company's pricing policies for Nutrasweet.
    However, Filippello said it was fair to assume that
Monsanto priced Nutrasweet at a lower rate for the diet soda
market.
    Nutrasweet sales have been falling since the fourth quarter
of 1986 when medical studies raised questions about its
possible side effects, such as migraine headaches.
    Monsanto acquired G.D. Searle and Co, Nutrasweet's maker in
1986.

<TITLE>TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Guy Collins</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Louvre accord on currency stability,
which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since
last February, appeared in serious danger today as a
transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to
the boil, foreign exchange dealers said.
    But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and
bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial
countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem
between the United States and West Germany and insisted that
the currency pact was still alive.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market
fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term
interest rates. ""That's not in keeping with the spirit of what
we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,""
Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was
referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group
of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the
pact.
    Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both
have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic
growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.
Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.
    However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre
agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate
move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.
    ""The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that
he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets
are off in terms of currency cooperation,"" Chris Johns, currency
analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.
    But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine
view, telling Reuters that ""the exchange market is apparently
reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker
comment will regret it later on.""
    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the
Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to
respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for ""a faithful
and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the
Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.""
    Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British
Treasury commented on the row.
    But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite
U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, ""this does
not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the
Louvre Accord.""
    In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive
of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that
following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.
Was still committed to the accord.
    In a move which the market interpreted as a possible
gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term
liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on
Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected
medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also
stepped into the French money market to hold down rates,
injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose
close to eight pct.

<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mining group Boliden AB said it had
agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral
Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to
exploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal.
    Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told Reuters the Swedish
group would  be responsible for the technical side of the
operation and would have no control over the product itself.
    He said one option under discussion for refining the gold
ore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter in
northern Sweden.
    Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it
was strategically important since it increased Boliden's
presence in Saudi Arabia.
    ""Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar
already...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the
future,"" he said.
    The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab
in the west of the country and should open in the first half of
1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold
smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.
    Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi
Arabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to
open in modern times.

technology and knowhow,"" said the group's chief executive, Kjell

    Company officials told a news conference that Wang will
also announce new entry level and high end computers within the

from Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC>, the world's largest maker of
minicomputers.
   
    Minicomputers are medium sized machines usually used within
a department or work group of a larger company and typically
cost between 10,000 and 500,000 dlrs.
    The VS 5E will replace Wang's entry level VS 5. Priced at

supported by the five and has three times the disc capacity of
the older system.
    The VS 6E can support up to 32 users, double the capacity
of the model six it replaces, and has three times the storage
capacity of the older model. The 6E is priced at 22,000 dlrs.

pct more than the older model and has twice the main memory
capacity. It is priced at 44,000 dlrs.
    The new VS 7010, which acts as an entry level system for
Wang's more powerful 7000 family of minicomputers, can support
between 30 and 55 users. It is priced at 75,000 dlrs.

<TITLE>UK SUGAR FACTORY CLOSES DUE TO SHORTAGE OF BEET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Sugar Plc was forced to shut its
Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute
shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a
Reuter inquiry
    Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination
of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the
factory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's
hurricane which blocked roads.
    The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are
cleared and supplies of beet build up again.
    This is the first time in many years that a factory has
been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.
    Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,
but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.
    Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British
Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year
out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.
    Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting
problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining
its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2
mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the
spokesman said.
    British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.
    The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,
is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories
normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the
campaign.
    As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been
harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13
pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has
severely restricted beet lifting.
    Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet
available.

<TITLE>U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY Susan Zeidler</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>A voluntary compliance system for
monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed
skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and
trade sources.
    ""Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and 
importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of
the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it
became a matter of the trade monitoring each other,"" one
analyst said.
    On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said
the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a
voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to
monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.
    Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee
importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the
U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring
authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,
it will still be allowed entry.
    While many believe producers will not seek to add to the
overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some
will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of
monitoring controls, trade sources said.
    ""Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted
to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,"" a
U.S. Customs spokesman said.
    ""Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when
its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand
Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to
destination),"" he said.
    Many see it as a true test of whether producers and
importers will abide by the quota system.
    ""It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the
quota agreement,"" said one major U.S. roaster.
     ""Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did
not act as a gentleman,"" said another analyst adding, ""without
the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the
producers' hands.""
    Some feel that importers will take advantage of the
voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,
in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.
Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member
countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely
labelled.
    According to customs officials, several green coffee
importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee
fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,
forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy
beans.
    ""If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for
one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of
their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by
circumventing the quota provisions,"" said Paine Webber analyst
Bernie Savaiko.
    Still, others believe that producers will not be hard
pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in
the U.S. in the near term.
    ""It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not
have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system
seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so
much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a
threat,"" one trader said.

said it filed a suit charging Bregman Partners and its
affiliates unlawfully planned to acquire control of the
company.
    In a suit filed in U.S. District Court, International
Multifoods said Bregman Partners and its affiliates, who
reportedly hold 7.4 pct of the company's shares, tried to
induce Multifood's management to join them in an effort to take
the company private and give controlling interest to Bregman
Partners. Bregman Partners include the interests of the
Belzberg families of Canada.
    The complaint also discloses that on each occasion,
Multifoods management rejected the group's overtures.
    Multifoods is asking Bregman's group to divest its shares
in open market sales in a manner not to further disrupt the
market place, according to the suit. The suit seeks
compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be
determined.
    In addition, Multifoods is seeking to stop Bregman Partners
from acquiring any more stock, or voting the shares it
reportedly owns, the suit said.
    According to Multifoods, the actions proposed by Bregman
Partners would prevent shareholders from realizing the full
benefits of the company's restructuring.
    In the past three years, Multifoods has substantially
altered its domestic business mix by divesting its U.S.
consumere foods operations and emphasizing growth in selected
segments of the U.S. foodservice industry.

<TITLE>SALOMON NOT PULLING OUT OF EUROYEN BONDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Salomon Brothers Inc> is not withdrawing
as a market maker in euroyen bonds, contrary to strong market
rumours circulating in London, a London-based spokeswoman for
the company's New York headquarters said.
    Earlier, a spokesman for Salomon Brothers' London
operations declined to comment at all on rumours that have been
circulating here.
    Euroyen bond traders had said they were informally
contacted by their counterparts at Salomon and told that they
would no longer be market makers in those securities.
    The traders said that Salomon had not notified the
Association of International Bond Dealers (AIBD) of its plans
to withdraw as a market maker. Under new rules recently adopted
by the AIBD, notification would be required if the firm decided
it no longer wished to make two-way prices at all times in
euroyen bonds.
    According to dealers at several Japanese banks, Salomon's
euroyen bond traders have been in a meeting and unavailable to
make prices. Market sources said that Salomon had offered the
traders a chance to remain with the firm if they were willing
to trade eurobonds denominated in other currencies.
    Dealers noted that at one point this year, euroyen bond
issuance had actually outpaced that of eurodollar denominated
bonds, the first time the U.S. Unit has been eclipsed as the
currency of choice for international borrowers.
    Dealers said that given the dollar's recent weakness, the
yen could once again top the eurobond issuance tables.
    Last week, Salomon Brothers announced it would trim its
worldwide staff by 800 and withdraw from several areas of
business, most specifically short term bank lending.

<TITLE>U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - COMPANIES ON SIDELINES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By John Picinich</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The recent sharp rise in U.S. interest
rates sparked turmoil in the fixed-income markets, but
underwriters said they doubt company treasurers will rush to
borrow before rates increase further.
    ""Corporate treasurers will continue to issue new debt when
they believe they are borrowing at an attractive rate,"" said an
underwriter with a major Wall Street house.
    Said another, ""We will not see a flood of new offerings.
Treasurers are reassessing the market. We will not see new
issuance dry up either.""
    Still, the pace of corporate borrowing in the public
finance market has slowed, according to a Reuter tabulation.
    Last week, which was shortened by the Columbus Day holiday,
saw issuance of 1.3 billion dlrs of new debt. That was down
from the prior week's tally of slightly more than two billion
dlrs of new debt.
    In contrast, a year ago it was not unusual to see those
amounts of new offerings in a single day as companies took
advantage of the then decline in interest rates to refinance
old, higher-cost debt or to expand operations via financings at
low, attractive rates, underwriters noted.
    ""Companies will conduct financings that they believe are
essential,"" said an underwriter with a medium-sized Wall Street
firm. ""But we will not see much more than that until the market
stabilizes.""
    In the meantime, treasurers will probably prefer shorter
term issues, analysts said. For instance, of last week's nine
issues, only one had a maturity of more than 10 years.
    The other offerings had maturities of two to seven years,
with most clustered in the two to three year area, according to
a Reuter tabulation. That is because single-digit interest
rates were had last week only among two-year securities.
    ""If people think that interest rates will continue to head
higher, then we could see treasurers rushing to market,"" said a
trader with a medium-sized securities house.
    ""But if people think last week's sharp interest rate rise
is a fluke, treasurers will sit back and wait for rates to
decline before issuing new debt, hoping of course that they are
not missing the boat by doing so,"" she added.
    Another impediment to new issuance is the lukewarm
reception to new issues by institutional and retail investors
in recent weeks, traders pointed out. Many investors refrained
from buying because they believed rate would rise further.
    ""We saw a lot of buying interest last week, but people are
not yet willing to pull the trigger,"" a broker said. ""They
would rather wait and see if the recent rate increase can be
sustained.""
    Conflicting forecasts on the likely direction of interest
rates did not help, analysts said. For instance, Henry Kaufman,
chief economist with Salomon Brothers Inc, said in his weekly
""Comments on Credit"" that the yields of U.S. Treasury bonds
would probably rise further because the marketplace expects
inflation to rise and the dollar to continue to decline.
    In contrast, Standard and Poor's Corp said on Friday that
prices of debt securities in the fixed-income markets would
recover. The rating agency said neither the economy nor the
dollar justify current high yields.
    Meanwhile, the Chicago Board of Trade is slated to hold a
press briefing on Tuesday in New York about its plans to list a
futures contract based on a corporate bond index.
    That follows last week's announcement by Commodity Exchange
Inc, Comex, that it plans to list on October 29 a new futures
contract based on the investment-grade corporate bond index of
Moody's Investors Service Inc.

the same time a year ago.
    Financial Corp, the nation's largest thrift, reported a

compared with an 11.6 mln dlr profit last year.
    At the end of the quarter scheduled items, or non- or
under-performing assets, were 1.34 billion dlrs, or 4.01 pct of
total regulatory assets, down from 1.77 billion, or 5.20 pct of
assets at the end of the 1986 third quarter, the company said.
    In reporting third quarter results the company also said
its highest priority is to raise capital and strengthen its

    Financial Corp has said it needs about one billion dlrs to
bring its regulatory net worth up to Federal Government

    In  addition, Financial Corp said its real estate group
sold properties totaling 154.8 mln dlrs in book value before
reserves during the quarter and 435.5 mln dlrs of real estate
for the nine months to September 30.
    The company also said it had a net deposit decrease of

proposal to the company, but said it has not decided whether it
will pursue a Calmat acquisition on a non-negotiated basis.
    Industrial Equity (Pacific), which currently holds 5.83 mln
Calmat common shares, said it is also evaluating the company's

<TITLE>STUDY SAYS PORK LEANER THAN USDA FIGURES SHOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Chicago, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>An Iowa State University study showed
pork contains considerably less fat than indicated by
long-established U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, the
National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said.
    Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study
averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American Heart
Association guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of all
the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained
less than six pct fat, the NPPC said.
    Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the
established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat
content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.
    Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs
for the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy
between the study and the USDA handbook.
    ""Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information
that has been accumulated over the past 30 years. The
statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today
which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago,
thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,""
Kline said.
    The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money,
evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories
from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fat
content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat,
moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.

<TITLE>SOVIETS OUTLINE 1988 ECONOMIC TARGETS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tony Barber</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Union outlined its economic
targets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improve
standards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.
    Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet
industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a
planned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.
    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent
to gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a
planned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the
output of a country's goods and services.
    He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of
grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow
produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.
    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described
machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is
essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on
world markets.
    ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the
machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a
considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" said
Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.
    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes
machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,
increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987
compared with the same period last year.
    However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned
for the industry for the whole of 1988.
    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent
meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to
a large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scale
measures are planned to save resources,"" he said.
    Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that
defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same
figure as was announced last year.
    Western governments view official Soviet estimates for
defense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure
is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are
intertwined with the civilian economy.
    Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending
next year on medical services, education, pensions and social
insurance schemes.

<TITLE>TASS DENOUNCES U.S. ATTACK ON IRAN AS ADVENTURISM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The official Soviet news agency Tass
denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in
the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would
bring no dividends to the Reagan administration.
    Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration
had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect
attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms
to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.
    ""The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that
the latest military adventure will not bring political
dividends to the American administration,"" Krutikhin said.
    Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on
Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were
concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.
    Soviet officials have previously criticized the United
States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their
presence serves to increase tension.
    Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and
Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought
broader contacts with Iran in the last year.
    Krutikhin said: ""The United States has undertaken an act of
armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has
long been spoken of by Washington officials.""

<TITLE>CALFED &lt;CAL> POSTS RECORD THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>CalFed Inc said strong loan volume
and higher net increase income at its principal subsidiary,
the California Federal Savings and Loan Association,
contributed to the best third-quarter and nine-month results in
the company's history.
    On a per-share basis, CalFed's fully diluted earnings were
1.80 dlrs for the third quarter of 1987 and 4.87 dlrs for the
nine months ended Sept 30, 1987, compared with 1.75 dlrs and
4.76 dlrs in the comparable 1986 period.
    CalFed is a 23.1 bln dlr diversified financial-services
company.
    ""Key factors leading to the company's higher earnings were
continued strong loan volume, an increase in net interest
income and higher earnings from non-real estate sources,"" said
George Rutland, president and chief executive officer of the
firm of CalFed Inc.
    Net earnings in the third quarter of 1987 were 50 mln dlrs,
a 3.1 pct gain over 48.5 mln in the same period last year. They
increased 3.9 pct in the first nine months of this year
compared with last year, totalling 134.6 mln dlrs against 129.6
mln.
    California Federal Savings and Loan Association contributed
net earnings of 44.5 mln dlrs for the third quarter of 1987
compared with 43.4 mln for the third quarter of 1986. For the
nine-month period ended Sept 30, it had net earnings of 116.3
mln dlrs against 114.9 mln in the comparable 1986 period.
    California Federal's net interest income for the third
quarter of 1987 rose 18.1 pct to 131.6 mln dlrs, up from 111.4
mln for the third quarter of 1986. For the first nine months of
1987, it totalled 383 mln dlrs, a 13.9 pct increase over 336.2
mln in the comparable 1986 period.
    CalFed Inc said that the increase in its subsidiary's net
interest income was a result of higher average balances of
interest-earning assets for the savings and loan operations.
    CalFed said the savings and loan unit's loan originations
were unchanged in the third quarter of 1987 compared with last
year at 1.8 billion dlrs. But for the first nine months of
1987, they rose to 5.4 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion in 1996.
    California Federal's provision for loan losses rose to 19.4
mln dlrs in the 1987 third quarter compared with 15.5 mln last
year and to 63.3 mln for first the nine months of 1987 compared

<TITLE>BANK PURCHASE SLOWS SECURITY PACIFIC &lt;SPC> NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC> said
growth in its third-quarter earnings was slowed by the purchase
of Rainier Bancorp and the suspension of interest payments on
Brazilian and Ecuadorian loans that were placed on a
non-accrual status earlier this year.
    The bank said it earned 128.1 mln dlrs in the third
quarter, up from 118.3 mln a year earlier. On a per-share
basis, income was 1.16 dlrs a share, up from 1.09 dlrs.
    The bank said non-recurring costs of 10.1 mln dlrs
associated with the acquisition of Rainier, a 9.5-billion-dlr
Seattle-based concern, cut earnings per share by nine cents.
    Security Pacific also said the suspension of interest
payments on the Brazilian and Ecuadorian debt reduced net
income by 8.1 mln dlrs, or seven cents a share.
    Security Pacific completed its acquisition of Rainier on
August 31. Security Pacific's results have been restated to
reflect the ""pooling-of-interests"" acquisition.
    ""Our third-quarter performance was strong, clearly
demonstrating the stability and balance in our earnings
streams,"" said Richard Flamson, chairman and chief executive
officer. ""The addition of Rainier,"" he continued, ""adds very
significantly to the strength of our western banking network.""
    The inclusion of Orbanco and Arizona Bancwest earnings
affected comparison of most financial categories.
    Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income was 602.4 mln
dlrs, up from 538.6 mln. The suspension of interest payments on
Brazilizan and Ecuadorian debt reduced net interest income by
41.9 mln dlrs.
    Non-interest income rose to 471.6 mln dlrs from 412.1 mln.
    Third-quarter provision for credit losses was 89.6 mln
dlrs, down 17.9 mln dlrs. As a percentage of average loans and
lease financing, net credit losses were 0.68 pct, down from
0.79 pct a year earlier.
    Non-performing loans and leases were 2.038 billion dlrs at
the end of the quarter, or 3.96 pct of loans and leases, up
from 1.377 billion a year ago.
    Other non-interest expense, composed of staff and other
expenses, was 757.6 mln dlrs, up from 616.2 mln. The rise
included an increase in staff expenses to 379.7 mln dlrs from
313.0 mln dlrs.
    Excluding Orbanco and Arizona Bancwest, average loans grew
11 pct. Real estate and international loan growth had the
greatest rises of 16 pct and 15 pct, respectively.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>IC Industries Inc said its board approved
a second major step in the reorganization and restructuring of
the company.
    To implement the plan of sharpening its strategic focus on
consumer goods and services, the company will give serious
consideration to the sale of its Pneumo Abex, its aerospace and
defense company, if it can realize a price which will return
maximum value to shareholders.
    In 1986, Pneumo Abex had operating income of 118.1 mln dlrs
on sales of 900.5 mln dlrs.
    IC said it will use the proceeds of any asset sale to
invest in new high-return businesses in the consumer goods and
services field.
    The company said it authorized a program to repurchase
between 500 mln dlrs and 1.0 billion dlrs of IC's common stock
from time to time when conditions warrant.
    It also said it will begin an immediate cost-reduction
program to cust annual operating expenses by 50 mln dlrs.
    An IC spokesman said the cost-reduction program involved
""across-the-board"" cuts rather than specific about targeted
areas.
    IC's board earlier approved a plan to spin off the
company's Illinois Central Gulf Railroad to shareholders. The
company's other major subsidiaries are Pet Inc, Pepsi-Cola
General Bottlers, Midas International Corp and Hussmann Corp.

Negotiations Michael Duffy said his country and Third World
commodity producers have formed an effective lobby group
against farm export subsidies and market access restrictions.
    Duffy told a press conference the Cairns Group of 14 major

has emerged as an important third force in any multilateral
trade talks. ""There's no doubt that the Cairns Group is being
seen as a third force to be reckoned with both inside the

    Duffy, here on a three-day visit after talks in the United

considerable progress has been made by the group towards
fighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developed
countries.
    The minister said the EC Commission's new farm trade paper

Common Agricultural Policy and its future expansion.

<TITLE>SWISS ANALYSTS SAY MOOD ON MARKETS PRECARIOUS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Donald Nordberg and Michael Shields</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Today's sharp sell-off of Swiss stocks and
matching falls around Europe may have been overdone, but the
mood on financial markets is precarious, Swiss securities
analysts and economists said.
    Panic selling took Swiss shares down six pct at the opening
on enormous volume, triggered by the slide on Wall Street and
the threat of renewed currency instability.
    ""I have never experienced anything like this, and I've been
in the business for 20 years,"" said Bernhard Wyttenbach, head of
European research at Union Bank of Switzerland.
    The analysts blamed the sell-off in Europe on U.S. Monetary
authorities. This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
publicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetary
policy. He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilise
currencies was still working, but added: ""On the other hand, we
will not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interest
rates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the United
States will raise rates.""
    Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) in
Zurich said: ""The situation is very dangerous. Statements by the
U.S. Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates.""
    Herbert Fritschi, director of Zurich Cantonal Bank's
financial research department, called the sell-off ""overdone,""
but warned that the situation could worsen unless central banks
loosen their monetary policy.
    ""I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over,"" he
said. ""The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step in
with an easy money policy, or else there is going to be an
economic catastrophe. They have to act quickly.""
    Wyttenbach said the ""Black Monday"" sell-off was clearly
exaggerated, with Swiss Reinsurance Co participation
certificates falling 20 pct in value at one point.
    But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correction
would come soon. First, the bad news will reach small investors
only in time for tomorrow's market, when there could be
another, smaller selling wave.
    ""As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key --
then we'll get a strong movement upward,"" Wyttenbach said. But
that may not come soon.
    ""People are simply worried that in America, where the market
has now fallen by 18 pct since August, the bull market is over,""
he said. ""People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988.""
    Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the current
problems and the weak dollar, Wyttenbach said. ""We do not have a
mark problem, we have a dollar problem,"" he added, but said the
biggest culprit was the new chairman of the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan.
    Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that the
dollar might be too high in the medium term and that interest
rates might have to rise. ""As a central banker he shouldn't do
that,"" Wyttenbach said. ""There is a danger that we will fall back
into the 1970s,"" he said. ""We have a real crisis of confidence in
Greenspan. I would much rather have a Volcker.""
    Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11.
    Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: ""I'm relatively optimistic
because the situation looks too bad. The Fed certainly has to
intervene.""
    He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to take
any significant steps, adding that the focus of attention
remains on the United States.
    ""The panic started in New York, it has to end there.""
    The Cantonal Bank sent an advisory to customers suggesting
they not sell into a panicked market, but wait a while before
deciding what to do.

<TITLE>SOVIET UNION SETS 4.5 PCT INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told
the Supreme Soviet (parliament) industrial output is planned to
rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987.
    In the first nine months of this year, industrial output
rose by 3.6 pct.
    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent
to gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pct
against a planned 4.1 pct this year.
    He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in
1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year.
    The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986
and the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected the
harvest this year.
    Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineering
industry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described
as a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if the
Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets.
    ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the
machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a
considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" said
Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan.
    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes
machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,
increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of this
year against the same period of 1986. This is well below the
7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988.
    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo concluded at a recent
meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to
a large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scale
measures are planned to save resources,"" he said.
    Finance Minister Boris Gustev told the Supreme Soviet
defence spending in 1988 would total 20.2 billion roubles, the
same as announced last year.
    Talyzin said the Kremlin also had decided to increase
spending next year on medical services, education, pensions and
social insurance schemes
    He said state expenditures in these fields would reach 171
billion roubles in 1988, or 3.5 billion roubles more than had
originally been envisaged in the 1986-1990 Five-Year Plan.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co said
it plans to build a new computer that incorrates a unified
version of its UNIX System IV operating system and Sun
Microsystems Inc's recently annouced SPARC micropocessor.
    The SPARC chip is based on reduced instruction-set
computing, or RISC, technology. 
    ATT said the version of UNIX used by the new computer will
incorporate po;ular features of the Berkeley 4.2 system, a
dirative of the UNIX system used widely in scientific and
engineering markets, as well as features of SunOs, a variant of
the Berkely system sold by Sun.
    ATT said it would take 18 months to two years to develop
new computers based on the Sun microchip and the merged version
of the UNIX operating system.
    Vittorio Cassoni, president of ATT's newly-formed Data
Systems Group, said the company will not offer the new machines
until the merged version of UNIX is completed.
    ""It's the software that will determine the availability of
products based on SPARC,"" he said.
    Eventually ATT's entire line of 3B mini computers will be
converted to the SPARC architecture, Cassoni said.
   
    The investment of all current users will be protected,
meaning that they will be able to maintain the software used on
the current 3B line, he said.
    Cassoni also said ATT's sales of computers declined in the
first nine months of the year compared with the first nine
months of last year.
    The lower sales were primarily the result of ATT's
transition to a new line of computers, he said.
    However, ""demand for the new products is way, way above
expectation,"" he stated.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The White House said the federal
budget deficit for fiscal 1988 will total 163 billion dlrs if
Congress and the administration fail to agree on a legislative
package of deficit reduction measures prior to a Nov. 20
deadline.
    In a report issued under the requirements of new balanced
budget legislation approved by Congress in September, the White
House budget office predicted the government would take in 903
billion dlrs in revenues and spend 1.066 trillion during fiscal
1988, which began Oct. 1.
    Under the terms of the new law, the government's failure to
agree on a deficit reduction package by Nov. 20 would trigger
across-the-board spending cuts of 23 billion dlrs.
    The White House report said this would reduce those defense
spending programs covered by the legislation by 10.5 pct and
would cut domestic programs by 8.5 pct.
    This magnitude of reductions would shear 11.5 billion dlrs
from defense and 11.5 billion dlrs from domestic programs.

1988 budget deficit at 179.3 billion dlrs.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. warships attacked and destroyed
an Iranian oil platform on Monday in retaliation for Friday's
Iranian attack damaging a U.S.-flagged ship, U.S. Defense

    When asked how much was left of the oil platform,
Weinberger said, ""Nothing.""
    ""There was no Iranian reaction,"" he said. ""... We consider
this matter is now closed.""
    Weinberger said four U.S. destroyers attacked the platform
about 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf with fire
at 0700 EDT, Weinberger said.
    ""We chose a platform used by the Iranians to interfere with
and be a source of potential attack on convoys...,"" Weinberger
said at a Pentagon briefing. 
    ""We know it has been used indeed, to not only launch small
boat attacks on shipping but to fire on U.S. helicopters...

U.S. forces in the future,"" Weinberger said of the U.S. Navy's
operation to escort oil tankers through the Gulf.
    ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will
be prepared to meet any escalation of military actions by Iran
with stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said.
    He said the 20 to 30 Iranian personnel on the oil platform
were given a 20-minute warning to abandon the platform.
    ""As far as we know they did abandon the site,"" he said.
    Weinberger was asked why the United States had chosen to

<TITLE>S.KOREA CURRENT A/C SURPLUS SEEN NEAR 10 BLN DLRS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's national news agency, Yonhap,
said this year's current account surplus will near 10 billion
dlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for the
country's cheap cars and electronic goods.
    Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny the
Yonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its own
figures later in the week.
    Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the current
account, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled
7.03 billion dlrs.
    This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for the
whole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks with
the International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapid
revaluation of the won against the dollar.
    The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,
up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier.
    ""Exports in October could be relatively modest due to many
public holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus will
be well over nine billion dollars, close to ten,"" Yonhap said.
    The sharp rise in the September surplus came from a
resumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previous
month.
    More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,
electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrest
between July and September.
    The South Korean government originally targeted a five
billion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raise
this to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half export
boom.
    If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplus
seemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the United
States which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit with
Seoul last year, government economists said.
    The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressure
at home, has called on South Korea to open more markets to
American goods and revalue the won faster.
    The won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on Monday,
representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year.

<TITLE>AIRCRAFT ATTACK IRANIAN OIL RIGS IN SOUTHERN GULF</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Unidentified jets attacked three Iranian
oil rigs in the southern Gulf early on Monday, setting at least
one of them ablaze, regional shipping sources said.
    Earlier today in Washington, U.S. Television networks had
reported that American forces launched a retaliatory strike
against Iran late Sunday, attacking two Iranian offshore oil
drilling platforms and setting them ablaze.
    The shipping sources said Iran's Sassan, Rostam and Rakhsh
offshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 GMT) by a
wave of jet fighter bombers. Smoke was seen spiralling up from
the Rostam field soon after.
    At least one of the other two targets was also believed to
be ablaze, the sources said.
    The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqi
air strikes in the past, but Baghdad had not reported any
southern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack.
    Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iran
used its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and
later speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway.
    U.S. Officials had been meeting on a response since Friday
when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a
U.S.-flagged ship. President Reagan said on Sunday he had
already made a decision on the U.S. Response to Friday's Iran
attack but would not say what the decision was.

<TITLE>SAUDI TO REMAIN AS KEY LPG SUPPLIER TO JAPAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Masaru Sato</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the key
supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least
the next five years, oil industry sources said.
    Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and
butane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi
Arabian LPG, the sources said.
    They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate
of crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. ""Saudi
is a reliable supplier in that sense,"" said one trader.
    Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.
    No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an
LPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.
    ""Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,
which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf
could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities
in that area,"" said another trader.
    Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20
pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at
Al-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to
contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from
other ports.
    Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude
rather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG
supply disruptions, traders said.
    They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was
unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.
    Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly
rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a
moderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.
    Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift
slightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from
Indonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.
    The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in
large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian
LPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the
year ended March 1987, the sources said.
    But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down
term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on
the spot market, they said.
    Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which
5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term
contracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of
Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.
    Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made
some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the
recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the
Japanese will accept the offer, the sources said.
    The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been
unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to
replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.
    Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by
Petromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87
pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)
of Arabian Light.
    Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings
should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian
Light's GSP.
    Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the
95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,
the trade sources said.
    Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying
up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to
seller-buyer agreement.
    Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut
supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.
    ""If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable
basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,"" said
an official at a major importer. ""Freight costs are higher for
cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a
longer haul and war risk insurance payments.""
    Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to
finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on
contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to
current levels, the sources said. ""When we talk business, we
would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of
high dependence on a single supplier,"" said one.

Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens' coalition and asked
him to try to form a new government.
    Because of the crisis, Banque Generale du Luxembourg SA
(BGL) has delayed a public issue for one billion Luxembourg
francs, originally scheduled for the end of last week, BGL
director Robert Sharfe said.
    He said the issue would probably go ahead later this week.
    It is likely there will be an upward adjustment in interest
rates on Luxembourg franc bond private placements, banking
sources said. However, no new placements are scheduled for
another 10 days.
    The latest issue last Friday for Swedish Export Credit Corp
(SEK) carried a coupon of 7-1/2 pct, whereas in previous issues
the interest was set lower at 7-3/8 pct.
    Interest rates on the Luxembourg franc, which is in parity
with the Belgian franc, are strongly affected by Belgian rates.
    On Friday, Belgium increased the rate on three-month
Treasury certificates by 0.5 pct to 7.15 pct as the Belgian
franc came under pressure.
    Private placements in Luxembourg francs have become
increasingly popular, particularly with Scandivanian borrowers,
because they carry a relatively low interest rate.
    Private investors also have flocked to buy Luxembourg franc
bond issues because the franc was seen as a fairly strong
currency.

<TITLE>NBC NEWS SAYS U.S. HAS RETALIATED AGAINST IRAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. television networks said on
Monday that U.S. forces launched a retaliatory strike against
Iran late Sunday, apparently attacking two Iranian offshore oil
drilling platforms.
    NBC News said it understood six Iranians had been pulled
from the sea.
    It said cautiously that U.S. forces attacked late Sunday
and that two Iranian oil platforms east of Bahrain were ablaze
as a result, but CBS News and other networks said flatly that
U.S. forces attacked the Iranian oil platforms.
    U.S. officials had been meeting on a response since Friday
when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a
U.S.-flagged ship.
    President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a
decision on the U.S. response to Friday's Iran attack but would
not say what the decision was.
    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Saturday the
attack on a U.S.-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters on Friday was
almost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile.

<TITLE>INDIAN RESERVE BANK TIGHTENS CREDIT POLICY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOMBAY, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reserve Bank of India said it was
tightening its credit policy for commercial banks by raising
their cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct to 10 pct, effective from
October 24.
    The move, announced last weekend, is part of the bank's
policy for the second half of fiscal 1987/88 ending March and
is aimed at curbing excess bank liquidity.
    The central bank also put selective controls on bank
advances to the oilseeds, vegetable oils and foodgrains trades.
    ""The policy's main objective is to fully meet the credit
requirements of agriculture, industry and exports, while
preventing excessive monetary expansion,"" bank Governor R.N.
Malhotra told an earlier meeting of chief executives of banks.
    Malhotra said the rate of monetary expansion must be kept
under control in the second half of the current financial year.
    Bank deposits rose 75.40 billion rupees in the first six
months of fiscal 1987/88 against 66.92 billion in the same
period last year, according to the bank.
    Bankers said the bank's move to raise the cash reserve
ratio by 0.5 pct will mean impounding about five billion rupees
from the banking system. Banks' total deposits are estimated at
around 1,000 billion rupees.
    They said banks are under pressure because of low returns
on commercial lending and investments in government securities.
    ""Already many banks are finding it difficult to maintain
their statutory liquidity and cash reserve ratios and are
resorting to heavy inter-bank borrowings,"" said one banker.

<TITLE>PUMA FIRST-HALF LOSS ABOUT 14 MLN MARKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MUNICH, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Puma AG Rudolf Dassler Sport &lt;PUMA.F> said
it posted a 1987 first-half group loss of about 14 mln marks,
of which the largest portion was in the U.S.
    Managing board chairman Armin Dassler told the annual
shareholders' meeting parent company turnover was expected to
fall to 650 mln marks over the whole year from 698.4 mln in
1986.
    No comparative figure for 1986 first half group loss was
available. In the whole of 1986 Puma posted a group
consolidated loss of 41.05 mln marks.
    Dassler said Puma hoped to improve performance in the U.S.
This year, where heavy losses were mainly responsible for the
1986 deficit.
    He said Puma expected to post a group loss in the second
half of this year but the shortfall would be lower than in the
first half. The same applied to expected parent company losses,
he added.
    Dassler said Puma had taken measures to improve future
performance.
    Dassler said the measures included changing Puma's  
product range, closing down some unprofitable factories in West
Germany and France and introducing general cost-cutting.
    He said Puma hoped to break even in 1988 in the U.S., Its
most important export market.
    Dassler said a personal payment he would make to
shareholders instead of a 1986 dividend was a goodwill gesture
which would not be repeated.
    Dassler said the payment to holders of Puma's 280,000
non-voting preference shares would amount to about 1.2 mln
marks, or 4.50 marks per share.
    Armin Dassler and his brother Gerd hold all of Puma's
720,000 ordinary voting shares. They offered the preference
shares to the public in July last year.
    Dassler said shareholders would benefit if Puma improved
performance next year. He did not elaborate.
    Dassler said he and his brother were planning to leave the
managing board and join the supervisory board.
    He said he was leaving for health reasons and because he
wanted to make way for a new chairman from outside the company.
His successor has not been made known yet.
    Dassler said today's meeting was expected to approve
Manfred Emcke as Puma's new supervisory board chairman,
replacing Vinzenz Grothgar.

<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Oilmeal demand remained strong in the
United States in July and August and six pct up on levels seen
in the same months last year, with most of the rise coming in
soymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.
    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose to
a record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pct
on the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal at
seven pct, it said.
    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and
330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago months
following a huge increase in soymeal imports.
    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediately
but went into stocks. With imports again large in September, it
estimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes by
October 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.
    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a year

sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to
bumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record

<TITLE>GERMAN FINANCIAL POLICY MAKERS IN RARE DISSENSION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's
central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are
normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the
central bank's independence.
    But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,
president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a
controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of
the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.
    Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last
Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and
interest rates
    Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's
criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place
for foreign investors.
    ""The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and
Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign
investors,"" said one economist for a London broker, who asked
not to be identified.
    Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial
policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to
steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.
    ""There are plenty of objective pressures which will result
in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill
feeling,"" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.
    News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct
withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in
a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and
abroad.
    Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the
finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the
Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting
details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.
    Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under
extraordinary pressures lately.
    Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his
deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight
inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had
pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.
    In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like
Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been
warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply
growth would eventually lead to rising prices.
    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank
council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his
views, bankers said.
    ""Poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said Commerzbank's
Pfister.
    ""Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not
entirely his own,"" said another economist.
    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,
they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark
and hurting West German exporters.
    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the
Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.
    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James
Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.
    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986
war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.
Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to
stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.
    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round
of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.
    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for
Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.
    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted
most popular government politician last year, had to face
resistance from local barons in the government coalition
parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.
    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising
4.3 billion marks.
    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will
push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the
government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.
    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row
which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.
    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last
month early to sort out a row in the northern state of
Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.
    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after
allegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavy
losses for the CDU in state elections.
    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last
weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.
    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more
remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and
was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this
year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government
gave Poehl another eight-year term.
    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he
hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.
    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was
not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the
Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.

<TITLE>HIGHER SPENDING EXPECTED IN MALAYSIA'S 1988 BUDGET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ho Wah Foon</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia's recovery from the worst
recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the
government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988
after seven years of austerity, economists said.
    ""Our country is walking on one leg now,"" said Ismail Salleh,
an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International
Studies. ""It has to depend on public sector investment for
faster growth if the private sector is not moving.""
    Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking
one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.
    The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under
two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct
because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.
Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and
semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.
    The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion
ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.
    Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct
in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.
    Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen
blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.
    One businessman said too many politicians give the
impression that Malaysia was unstable.
    ""If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential
to recover strongly is great,"" a banker said.
    Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in the
black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit
surplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.
    The government has said its fiscal policies will balance
the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.
    The government will also repay some of its external debt,
which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.
    Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt
ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential
goods are unlikely to change.
    Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the
corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to
compete for investors with neighbouring states.

Takeuchi said the exchange has no immediate plans to suspend
trading to cool off panic stock selling.
    However, he said Tokyo may consider such a measure if the
London and New York exchanges are closed overnight.
    ""I don't think it will happen,"" he added.
    He also told reporters the exchange will relax margin
requirements effective on Wednesday to encourage stock buying.
    Takeuchi said the sharp fall in stock prices was mostly due
to psychological factors.
    ""We need to keep close watch on market movement but we
expect the market will stabilise soon,"" he said, adding that
individual investors should remain calm. ""It is advisable to
wait for an autonomous recovery of the market,"" he said.
    The margin requirement in cash will be reduced to 50 pct
from 70 pct while the margin collateral requirement in equity
will rise to 70 pct from 60 pct, effective on Wednesday, he
said.
    Takeuchi also said the exchange has no specific plan to
take coordinated action with the New York and London exchanges
to help stabilise stock prices.
    The drop on Wall Street was caused by various factors but
was primarily the result of a correction of overvalued share
prices, he said. The current stock price plunge cannot compare
with the Great Depression as the economic environment is very
different, he added.
    The exchange has not changed plans to introduce stock
futures trading next year despite press reports that the Wall
Street fall was linked with futures trading, he said.

<TITLE>CHINA FORECASTS 397 MLN TONNES GRAIN HARVEST</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be
397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the New
China News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesman
as saying.
    The harvest will be China's second highest in history but
poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers
have kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.
    Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln
tonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.
    Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln
tonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09
mln in the same 1986 period.
    Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state prices
for grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase
the incentive for grain production.
    China could not afford to become a major food importer, he
said.
    The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's

<TITLE>PHILIPPINE INFLATION PREDICTED TO RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippine 1987 inflation rate will
rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government
implements an employers' association recommendation for a 10
pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month,
Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.
    The government's own proposal for an across-the-board daily
pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight
pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average
higher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.
    The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the
Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).
    The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation
rate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4
pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solita
said. Both were proposed last month.
    Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct
by the National Economic and Development Authority early this
month.
    In the first three months of the year, inflation was a
negative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5
and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National Statistics
Office said.
    The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pct
in July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and September
respectively, the National Statistics Office said.
    It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water
prices.
    The government's six and eight peso wage increases would
displace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the number
of unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population.

<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A sharp rise in Soviet sugar consumption
since the start of the Kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicates
home brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lost
vodka sales, Pravda said.
    The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales had
increased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned into
two billion bottles of moonshine.
    At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said,
this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the
equivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenues
from vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree.
    ""Official statistics show a reduction in consumption of
vodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count
home-brew,"" Pravda said.
    ""The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also
firmly settled into cities, where the availability of natural
gas, running water and privacy has made it much easier.""
    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol
campaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a first

<DATELINE>    OSLO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil)
&lt;STAT.OL>, operator on Norway's North Sea Veslefrikk oil field,
has placed field development contracts totalling 1.5 billion
crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a
statement.
    Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier
A/S &lt;KVIO.OL> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert
Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating
production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed
well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.
    Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S
&lt;AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the
well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand
in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.
    Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a
fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field
partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several
months earlier than previously planned.
    Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln
barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km
west of Bergen.
    Statoil estimates the field's total development cost,
including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output
is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.
    Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg
field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gas
will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from
Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.
    Partners on the field are Statoil, the operator, with a 55

<TITLE>LOUVRE ACCORD STILL IN EFFECT, JAPAN OFFICIAL SAYS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations
still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize
currencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.
    And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the
weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower
range for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank of
Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.
    ""The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and
anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it
later on,"" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.
    The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the
dollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he
noted.
    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in
monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would
never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar
against the mark or the yen.
    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between
140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.
    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and
141.35 yen.
    ""Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher
interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this
does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework
of the Louvre accord,"" the Finance Ministry official said.
    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any
further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only
hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt
problem.
    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their
interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets
further, the monetary officials said.
    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined
to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further
decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary
expectations in the U.S.
    ""That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre
agreement is still operative,"" the senior ministry official
said.
    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that
Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West
Germany's increase in short-term interest rates.
    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.
Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar
decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,
try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the
accord, foreign exchange dealers said.
    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional
statement that ""the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" and
this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the
dealers said.
    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in
Tokyo currency markets.
    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised
pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates
higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,
or international economic policy coordination.
    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's
economic policies and from time to time apply ""peer pressure"" to
persuade others to change their policies to a desired course,
they noted. ""Without such a basic agreement of multilateral
surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German
policy so openly,"" the ministry official said.
    The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy
should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy
coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse
of the Louvre agreement, the official said.
    He also said Japan has not received any specific request
from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term
money rates have been edging higher.
    ""This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking
policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate
rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,"" he
added.

    The move was seen by Oslo and London securities analysts as

<TITLE>ABE TIPPED TO BE NEXT JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yuko Nakamikado</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>No clear indication has emerged of the
victor in the race to succeed Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
but political analysts said it was becoming more likely that
former foreign minister Shintaro Abe would be chosen.
    A decision on which of the three contenders would be picked
was expected late today or early on Tuesday, they said.
    Japanese political leaders held a flurry of closed-door
meetings today and the three candidates called on Nakasone, who
is due to step down late this month, to mediate to break the
deadlock.
    The other candidates are Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
and former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita.
    They are vying for the post of president of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who is automatically prime
minister by virtue of the party's parliamentary majority.
    The new LDP president will be named formally at a party
convention on October 30 and elected prime minister by
parliament, probably on November 6, LDP sources said.
    Nakasone, 69, is due to retire on October 31 after five
years in the post, an exceptionally long term by Japanese
standards.
    Takeshita, who is head of the party's largest faction, had
steadfastly opposed the idea of seeking Nakasone's help, but he
told reporters: ""It is possible Nakasone will be given carte
blanche (for selection of his successor).""
    One political analyst, who declined to be identified, said
Nakasone, despite a personal preference for Miyazawa, is likely
to choose Abe as the best candidate for steering Japan through
its international problems and maintaining party unity. Abe
also would also accept Nakasone's influence, he said. Analysts
said one of Nakasone's prime aims is to retain as much power as
possible following his retirement.
    Takeshita, the early favorite because of the size of his
faction, is viewed by many politicians and analysts as being
unsuitable for the post of prime minister because of his lack
of international experience.
    The analysts said Nakasone also was very unlikely to
support Takeshita's bid because of the differences in their
political styles.

<TITLE>BALLADUR INSISTS ON MAINTENANCE OF LOUVRE ACCORDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of
the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major
industrial countries.
    Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look at
the accords, said ""I firmly desire a faithfull and firm
adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre
accords -- in both their letter and spirit.""
    On Sunday, Baker said last week's rise in short-term West
German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords.
    The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called
for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged
dollar slide.
    The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance
Ministers in Washington last month.
    But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate
rise was ""not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to.""
    ""What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to
simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their
part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow
them,"" he added.

<TITLE>RUBBER STOCK MANAGER SAYS QUALITY ACCEPTABLE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Roger May</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Rubber Organisation
(INRO) buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister said tests had
shown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable, but
acknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it.
    ""We have said all along that the rubber is holding up well
from a condition and quality standpoint...Rubber stored in
proper conditions does not deteriorate,"" he told Reuters in a
telephone interview. The quality of buffer stock rubber sold
since he entered the market in September would be discussed at
an INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said.
    Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest in
buying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possible
poor quality.
    Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the
""may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO's
five-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October
16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stock
was uppermost in consumers' minds.
    ""We have received good interest for the rubber. I understand
the Japanese concern. Many consumers want to try the rubber
before they carry on buying,"" he said.
    Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 different
locations in producing and consuming nations, adding all
warehouses used were suitable for long-term storage.
    Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the
past week to 10 days and this could reflect a ""wait and see
attitude"" by buyers, he said.
    ""Consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts
until they test out the rubber. If their tests are positiive,
they are likely to buy more."" Hofmeister said he could reduce
the offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest
but INRO did not want to depress prices artificially.
    Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimates
that he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpur
and New York since September.
    But he said Japanese traders were in a position to have an
idea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overall
had put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes.
    The question of sales from the original 360,000 tonne
buffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the Council
meeting which is scheduled to end on Thursday.
    The current international rubber pact expires on October
22.
    The deadline for the new pact's start is January 1989 and
Hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during
the interim period.

<TITLE>ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER N.Z. DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>An income tax surcharge and capital
gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of
the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.
    Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the
Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to
restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by
current government policies.
    The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn
would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.
He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could
be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.
    Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a
percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was
probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.
    He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct
value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,
but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.
Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary
impact of a currency depreciation.
    The government had failed to bring inflation down despite
lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.
    New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to
end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.
    The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation
policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and
insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss
said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt
and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.
    ""The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are
going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought
is soundly based -- primarily because the government's
macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,"" Bayliss said.

Iran in the Gulf, Tehran Radio reported.
    The U.S. Government ""is in a very difficult situation now
and it is not clear if it has the necessary elements for a
violent action,"" the radio quoted him as saying in an interview
with the English language daily Tehran Times.
    In Washington, President Ronald Reagan said he had decided
on a response to Iran, which the Americans blame for two
missile attacks on U.S.-related tankers in Kuwaiti waters last
week, but declined to say what the response was.

act in the Persian Gulf will greatly harm long-term U.S.
Interests,"" the radio, monitored in Nicosia, reported.
    On efforts for a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war, Khamenei
said: ""Declaration of the aggressor and a ceasefire should be
concurrent. Formation of a panel to determine the aggressor
necessarily preceeds the ceasefire.""

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand has imposed sanctions
against Fiji in response to that country's change of status to
a republic, acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said.
    The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut
economic aid. New Zealand will also not renew an agreement
which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in
March. The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about
10 mln dlrs a year.
    Palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
government had asked High Commissioner Rod Gates to return from
Suva for discussions about other possible measures.
    ""We won't be reacting further until these discussions with
the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held,""
Palmer said.
    The sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after
Colonel Sitivene Rabuka staged his second coup on September 25.
Implementation was postponed in the hope that Rabuka might turn
back from declaring a republic.
    Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from

    A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry of
Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind
and pack local coffee for export. Construction will start in
December and the factory should be ready by next October.
    He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee
Marketing Board to supply his company &lt;Unipack> with 24,000
tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi also
told reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loan
from the Banque Industrielle d'Afrique Oriental in Paris.
    Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, and
expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.
    Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit
Uganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln

latest International Coffee Agreement.
    In addition, the value of roasted coffee should be

agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed
during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet
Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.
    Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility

southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.
    Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of
its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.
    Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet

    Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf
war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined

<TITLE>COMPETITION TOUGHENS FOR NEAR-SUPERCOMPUTERS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Catherine Arnst</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>An announcement by Alliant Computer
Systems Inc &lt;ALNT> of a new low-end near-supercomputer and &lt;ETA
Systems Inc>'s unveiling of a high-end machine in the same
category show competition is stiff in this market, industry
analysts said.
     Consultants said Alliant's new FX computer, aimed mainly
at scientists and researchers will be priced between 100,000
and 200,000 dlrs and will be faster than anything else in that
price range. But they said Alliant is trying to bring prices in
line with discounts it now gives many of its customers.
    ""(The new FX) is significant to the extent that it
represents Alliant's recognition of the reality of the
marketplace,"" said a source who was briefed by Alliant on the
new computer. ""The list price is more in line with what they are
seeing anyway.""
    Near-supercomputers, often called mini-supercomputers,
resemble the massive supercomputers favoured by scientists but
are much less expensive and a quarter as powerful.
    Supercomputers cost well over one mln dlrs but
mini-supercomputers are generally priced between 200,000 dlrs
and one mln dlrs.
    Most near-supercomputers use a new computer architecture
called parallel processing, in which a problem is broken up
into segments and each segment assigned to a different
processor. General-purpose mainframe computers have just one
processor that works on one segment of a problem at a time,
making them too slow for complex scientific problems.
    Near-supercomputers have been in existence for only about
five years and the two leading manufacturers, Alliant and
Convex Computer Corp (CNVX), held two of the most successful
initial public offerings last year.
    But Alliant and Convex, a Texas company, are also facing
some 15 companies competing for between 200 and 250 mln dlrs in
sales this year, and the result has been lower prices and
shrinking profit margins.
    Heavy discounting, slow acceptance outside the scientific
market, lack of software and too many competitors also have
made analysts reassess prospects for near-supercomputers.
    Jeffrey Canin, computer analyst with Hambrecht and Quist,
said he just added a year to his original growth estimates for
the industry. He now expects sales to reach 1.1 billion dlrs in
1991, instead of 1990.
    In recent weeks both Alliant and Convex have said their
third quarter earnings would be reduced by ""competitive pricing
pressures.""
    Alliant said profits for the period will be about five
cents a share against eight cents last year, although revenues
for the period rose to 14.2 mln dlrs from 8.6 mln.
    Convex said third quarter earnings will be less than the
second quarter's 12 cents a share while revenues will rise
almost eight mln dlrs over the 1986 third quarter to between 18
and 18.5 mln dlrs.
    Until now, most of the price discounting occurred at the
bottom of the product line in near-supercomputers, but ETA
System's announcement could start squeezing Convex and Alliant
from the top, analysts said.
    ETA, a subsidiary of Control Data Corp &lt;CDC>, introduced
two machines that are really full-blown supercomputers similar
to those sold by Cray Research Inc, the world's biggest
supercomputer maker, but at half the price of Cray's cheapest
model. The ETA-10 Model P costs 995,000 dlrs and the Model Q is
1.2 mln dlrs.
    ETA officials told a news conference the new machines may
be classified as supercomputers but they are aimed directly at
the upper end of the product lines from Alliant and Convex.
    Acceptance of ETA's product could be hampered by lack of
software, analysts said, noting this is an issue that faces all
parallel processor makers to some degree.
    Because parallel processing is a new architecture that has
yet to be widely used, third party software vendors have been
slow to write programs for the near-supercomputers.
    ETA, however, ""offers a low priced entry into supercomputers
for some customers,"" one consultant said.
    Canin cautioned that ""the price pressures will continue for
some time"" and estimated that five percentage points have been
knocked off the gross profit margins of both Convex and Alliant
this year by price discounting.
    Next year, he said, the two companies will face a new set
of problems as they both introduce their second generation of
products. ""I am always cautious about the first major product
transition.""

<TITLE>TOKYO DEALERS SEE DOLLAR POISED TO BREACH 140 YEN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rie Sagawa</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watching
nervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below the
significant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.
    ""The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is
considered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the
currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,""
said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.
    The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday
closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.
    The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of
140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York
and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.
    The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.
    ""The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish
sentiment after Baker's comments,"" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He
said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among
the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the
Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.
    The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day
drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness
in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.
    Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he
strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest
rates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience
with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord
due to their fears of increasing inflation.
    Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary
pressures also slow domestic demand.
    West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to
boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade
deficit, Tanaka said.
    U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still
massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest
rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.
    ""Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations
coordinate dollar buying intervention,"" said Soichi Hirabayashi,
deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange
department.
    The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally

<TITLE>SOVIET INDUSTRIAL GROWTH/TRADE SLOWER IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet Union's industrial output is
growing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign trade
has fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show.
    Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show
industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of
1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.
    Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986
period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2
pct.
    Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion
roubles. Separate import and export figures were not given.
    One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction
of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last
year's calculations of industrial output included all goods,
irrespective of quality.
    Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special
inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below
standard.
    Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were
rejected in the nine-month period.
    The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more
than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000
people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,
Pravda said, without giving comparative figures.
    The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the
economy has been an important part of the modernisation
campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the
setting up of small shops on a private basis.
    Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months
against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.
    But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity
figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in
the West, which measures worker output over a given period.
    Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union
as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5
mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period
last year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against
194 roubles a year ago.

<DATELINE>    BERNE, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The prospect of a dominant alliance of
socialists and environmentalists ended as the Social Democrats
became the biggest losers in Swiss parliamentary elections.
    Projections by Swiss radio show the ruling centre-right
alliance of Radical Democrats, Christian Democrats, Social
Democrats and the People Party will likely hold on to power.
    Less than 48 pct of voters cast a ballot, a record low
turnout. The moderate left-of-centre Social Democrats lost six
of its previous 47 seats. The Green Party of Switzerland won 11
seats in the 200-seat lower house, a rise of eight. But the
Green Alliance and other green groupings lost one seat.
    The Radical Democrats, Christian Democrats, Social
Democrats and People Party are forecast to hold 159 seats, down
seven from the last election in 1983, and 42 of the 46 seats in
the upper house, down one.
    The projections showed the centre-right Radical Democrats
dropping four seats to 50 in the lower house, although they
would remain the largest party.
    The conservative Christian Democrats were seen losing one
seat to 41, while the right-wing People's Party, despite
forecast losses, added four to their previous 23 seats.

<TITLE>NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviets have not indicated an
urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely
that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit
expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng told Reuters.
    In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did
not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat
subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.
    ""Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.
There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that
there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a
wheat subsidy).""
    When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet
summit, Lyng said, ""No, I don't think so. I don't think that.""
    The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to
Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for
discussion at a summit.
    ""It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the
Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions
about,"" Lyng said.
    ""When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for
agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was
not something that would be discussed with the President of the
United States. He said it's not presidential,"" Lyng said.
    Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major
producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the
still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final
decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.
    The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement
will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the
Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the
long-standing agreement.
    ""We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have
failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would
love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,
but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.
These are some of the questions we need to discuss.""
    When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from
the agreement, Lyng said, ""I don't know. It certainly hasn't
been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running
they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an
agreement.""

<TITLE>LYNG SAYS INDIA FOOD AID PACKAGE NOT READY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States and India have
not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the
drought-stricken Asian country, Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said.
    Lyng told Reuters in an interview that the two countries
have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the
specifics of the offer to be announced during Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit here this week.
    ""We have been talking about the potential needs that India
might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs
as well as the possibilities of assistance,"" Lyng said.
    ""At this point, there is no detailed plan or program. The
amounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we have
indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in
whatever way they deem most valuable,"" he said.
    There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would
offer India subsidized vegetable oil under the export
enhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419
of an amended 1949 law.
    Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree
on the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and that
Washington would prefer the package include something other
than donated food.
    ""The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking care
of themselves. India is a country that has come a long way in
its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in
that,"" Lyng said.
    ""We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses we
still have of many commodities..., would like to share in the
import business the Indians do, and then we have some, as we
always do, compassion for the people of India and would like to
cooperate with them,"" he said.
    Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officials
during Gandhi's visit here, adding, ""I just don't know of
anything that might be announced specifically.""
    Asked if ""the ball was in the Indians' court,"" he said, ""Yes.""
    Gandhi is to leave Washington Tuesday evening.

<TITLE>SWISS 1988 BUDGET HAS 1.3 BILLION FRANC SURPLUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BERNE, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Swiss government's proposed 1988 budget
projects a 1.3 billion franc surplus, the Finance Ministry
announced.
    Income is expected to rise 11.6 mln francs to 27.22
billion, while expenditure is seen increasing 7.1 mln to 25.95
billion next year. After internal transfers, net income was
planned to total 637 mln francs.
    The ministry also announced that higher than expected
income during 1987 would likely boost this year's surplus
significantly higher than the 171 mln francs budgeted.
    The ministry said the encouraging development of
Switzerland's finances was due to steady economic growth since
1983 and the government's conservative fiscal policy.
    Although the dollar's weakness is likely to dampen economic
growth slightly in 1988 by depressing exports, domestic
investment and consumer demand were expected to remain strong.
    Real gross national product growth was seen rising two pct,
while annual inflation was also projected to reach two pct.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO SCRUTINISE LIFE INSURERS' CAPITAL GAINS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry plans to examine how
life insurance companies realised capital gains through
transactions undertaken in June, just before the yen bond
market began to fall sharply, a senior Ministry official said.
    The move is aimed at cooling fierce competition in the
field and will pave the way for a Ministry system to check that
insurers do not inflate investment returns on the accounts to
attract investors, he said.
    Some insurers transfer part of their unrealised gains from
general accounts to the variable life accounts, violating their
internal regulations, industry sources said.
    The eight major local life-insurers which offer variable
life policies here realised an average return of 21.01 pct on
such policies in the year ended September.
    The Ministry will scrutinise the policies of 17 local and
foreign life insurers which offer the variable life schemes.
    Japan has 23 major local life insurers, none of which is

<TITLE>LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. And West German reaffirmation of
support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental
problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the
current collapse in stock markets, London economists said.
    ""There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the
dollar is going to be allowed to slip,"" said Richard Jeffrey of
Hoare Govett. ""If not, there is going to be continued fear that
when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to
tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the
U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.""
    But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which
dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the
very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation
fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.
    ""If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street
...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,"" said
Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from
other London and Tokyo analysts.
    Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of
further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary
pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.
    Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the
equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.
    ""It would be suicidal for any government in the context of
what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their
interest rates,"" he added.
    Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime
lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed
chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial
system.
    The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock
collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking
crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.
    It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of
1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said
today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and
that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in
mind.
    ""The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.
If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic
growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a
more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,"" said Capel's
Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in
danger.
    ""The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is
disappearing from the equity markets,"" Dennis noted.
    David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world
market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven
(G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,
as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies
is still on.
    Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by
expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money
supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency
stability.
    But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said
Morrison. ""The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To
stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong,"" he said.

<TITLE>U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sandy Critchley</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg
surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to
nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as
long as sterling remains in its present robust state,
economists said.
    An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the
past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit
demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.
    ""In the normal course of events the markets would have been
extremely worried about that figure,"" noted Peter Spencer, U.K.
Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.
    After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,
which compared won stg August rise, U.K.
Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee
from plummetting equities into the relative security of
government securities.
    Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a
day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,
before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone
throughout.
    U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,
resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning
after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.
    Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks
would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a
rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, ""With
the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last
thing the Bank of England would want to do,"" Spencer said.
    ""The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as
sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,""
said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu
Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money
measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct
growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.
    But ""The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed
down is a rather encouraging sign,"" noted Paul Temperton, U.K.
Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a
fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money
aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.
    It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank
of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates
to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by
news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.
    Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in
that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.
    Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in
influencing consumer behaviour, he said.
    In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity
markets in the past few days, ""There will almost certainly be a
straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail
sales,"" Temperton said.
    ""Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in
consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,"" he added.
    ""I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending
figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very
serious panic and a flight to quality,"" Spencer said.
    A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look
at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,
adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly
than bank lending.
    Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending
was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy
personal sector borrowing.
    Figures from the Banking Information Service showed
personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66
billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much
of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.

by rising exports, have hit a record high and are likely to
soar to 72 billion U.S. Dlrs by the year end, central bank
officials said Tuesday.
    Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the
reserves totalled about 69 billion U.S. Dlrs, compared with
about 42 billion at the same time last year and 68 billion on
October 5. He declined to elaborate.
    A senior bank official, who declined to be named, told
Reuters the reserves were likely to reach 72 billion dlrs at
the end of the year.
    ""The surge in reserves is the result of our trade surplus
and recent purchases of U.S. Dollars on the local interbank
market,"" Chang said.
    Taiwan's trade surplus hit a record 14.95 billion U.S. Dlrs
in the first nine months of 1987 compared with 11.05 billion a
year earlier, official figures show.
    Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-hsien said the surplus
will rise to about 20 billion dlrs by the end of the year.
About 80 pct of the surplus will come from the island's trade
with the United States. 
    Chien said Taiwan's trade will reach 80 billion U.S. Dlrs
this year compared with 63.96 billion last year.

<TITLE>NORWAY BOOSTS OIL OUTPUT BY 22 PCT IN SEPTEMBER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OSLO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2
pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in
August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.
    Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at
several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at
fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field
rescue project.
    Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's
voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil
output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise
oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.
    Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the
production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all
its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.
    Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway
would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.
    The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which
pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,
field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.
    Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use
the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while
Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.
    BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula
field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping
to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.
    Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd
last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company
said.
    September production was also sharply higher at the
Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which
extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd
against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats
Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.
    Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like
Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd
in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous
month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.
    Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd
in September, compared with 100,188 in August.
    Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test
output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl
totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in
August.
    Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on
stream a second well, cutting September production to just two
days.

<TITLE>BAHRAIN OFFSHORE BANKING ASSETS RISE IN 2ND QTR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Assets of Offshore Banking Units (OBUs)
in Bahrain rose 11 pct in the second quarter of 1987 to reach
the highest level since early 1985, Bahrain Monetary Agency
(BMA) figures show.
    The BMA's quarterly statistical bulletin gave no reason for
the sharp rise, but economists said banks appeared to be
staying liquid because of the escalation of the Gulf crisis.
They said banks are parking funds in interbank markets outside
Bahrain.
    Despite the rise in assets, banks in Bahrain have been
retrenching operations considerably. At the end of 1986 there
were 68 OBUs compared with 74 at the end of 1985.
    BMA figures show OBU assets rose to 58.30 billion dlrs at
the end of June from 52.53 billion at the end of March and
55.68 billion at the end of 1986. The mid-1987 figure was the
highest since early 1985 when assets topped 61 billion.
    The second quarter rise came almost entirely in OBU assets
outside Bahrain. The volume of loans to the non-bank sector
declined slightly, indicating a still sluggish economy in the
region, economists said.
    Assets of commercial banks in Bahrain were slightly lower
at the end of the second quarter at 2.05 billion dinars
compared with 2.10 billion at the end of the first quarter.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tribune Co said a pre-tax charge of 16.7
mln dlrs or 11 cts a share in employee severance costs at the
New York Daily News led to a 73 pct decline in the company's
1987 third-quarter earnings.
    Tribune reported net income of 33,085,000 dlrs or 42 cts a
share, down from 123,450,000 dlrs or 1.53 dlrs in the 1986
third quarter.
    The company also said its 1986 third-quarter results were
boosted by a one-time pre-tax gain of 145 mln dlrs or 1.11 dlrs
a share from sale of its cable television systems.
    After adjusting for these extraordinary items, Tribune
President Stanton Cook said 1987 year-end should be strong.
    ""Overall, we expect Tribune company's earnings before
non-recurring factors to show solid improvement for 1987,"" Cook
said.
    A 14 pct increase in newsprint prices since the 1986 third
quarter depressed newspaper publishing operating profits, the
company said. They were up only slightly at 46.1 mln dlrs after
adjusting for Daily News severance costs, from 45 mln dlrs in
the 1986 quarter, it said.
    Increased efficiency at the Tribune's two paper mills,
however, contributed to a 56 pct gain in newsprint operating
profits to 21.8 mln dlrs from 14 mln dlrs, it said.

environmental protection, public transport and research and
development projects.
    ""Thanks to the favourable liquidity situation, debt will be
able to be repaid,"" the ministry said. ""That will reduce the net

reported lower third quarter profits, said its fourth quarter
and full year earnings will exceed the year ago results due to
strong sales in its domestic cosmetics business and an improved
economic situtation in Brazil.
    Last year Avon earned 158.7 mln dlrs or 2.23 dlrs a share
on sales of 2.9 billion dlrs.
    In the current third quarter Avon said its earnings dropped
12 pct to 37 cts a share because of a wage and price freeze in
Brazil, one of the company's four major operating areas.

about half of that loss was offset by the strong performance of

<TITLE>WILL WORLD RECESSION FOLLOW STOCK MARKET PLUNGE?</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Some economists fear a world recession if
stock exchanges continue to plunge. Others are more sanguine.
    The pessimists say the stocks shakeout is destroying
personal assets and dampening consumption.
    ""The real economic effects can be significant -- the
destruction of wealth and a deflationary impact on the economy,""
said an economist at a U.S. Securities house.
    But other economists said such fears were overblown.
    ""Because of lower appreciation of corporate or personal
assets, that much negative impact could be observed (in the
U.S.),"" said Keikichi Honda, general manager of economic
research at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
    ""But the appreciation of stock prices has not been playing
such a major role in the entire U.S. Gross national product
(GNP),"" Honda said.
    The pessimists noted that the record fall on Wall Street on
Monday was sparked by fears the U.S. Economy is heading for a
recession or serious slowdown much earlier than expected.
    But the optimists said a dampening effect on consumption
due to stock market losses was less likely in Japan.
    ""In Japan the weight of stocks in individuals' total assets
is less than in the U.S., And the total weight of individuals'
holdings in the stock market is less, so there will be less
damage than in the U.S.,"" said an economist at one of Japan's
major brokerage houses.
    ""Japan is taking strong measures to stimulate domestic
demand, so while there could be some impact from the reduction
of assets value, it would not be a major impact,"" said the Bank
of Tokyo's Honda.
    Optimists also pointed to incipient declines in U.S.
Interest rates as a positive sign for the U.S. Economy.
    ""U.S. Interest rates are coming down so there is a feeling
that interest rates have hit their ceiling, and the U.S.
Economy is strong, so there should be no direct impact from the
collapse of share prices,"" said Toshiaki Kakimoto, Sumitomo Bank
Ltd chief economist.
    Some economists suggested that should markets continue to
slump, the major industrial nations may have to discuss
possible joint lowering of official discount rates.
    ""Until last week, a discussion of lower rates was
unthinkable, now it's not,"" said the Japanese brokerage house
economist.
    ""There has been a move from the purely rational to the
emotional -- it's a central bankers' nightmare,"" said the
foreign economist. ""It will require strong global leadership by
politicians to snuff out,"" he said.
    However, ""previously, the stocks correction was due to fears
of higher interest rates, a possible resurgence of inflation
and the depreciation of the dollar,"" said Nobuyuki Ueda, senior
economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd.
    ""Now some people have an uneasy feeling about the outlook of
the U.S. Economy,"" Ueda said.
    ""If the stock market is a leading indicator of the future
movement of the economy, this decline will have very
significant implications for the U.S. Economy,"" he said.
    ""If the low levels hold, those who were keeping consumption
high because of unrealised gains could curb consumption,"" said
Salomon Brothers (Asia) Ltd economist Ron Napier. ""If the paper
gains aren't there, people won't spend.""
    A U.S. Recession could then trigger similar declines in
other economies, some economists said.
    ""I don't know if a possible recession in the U.S. Would
trigger a world recession because other nations, such as Japan,
are showing good economic performance,"" LTCB's Ueda said. ""But we
can't rule out the possibility because the U.S. Is still
playing a very dominant role in the world economy.""

quarter, up 47 pct or 109.7 mln dlrs, largely due to increased
income from foreign exchange trading, fees and commissions.
    Foreign exchange trading income totaled 71.3 mln dlrs, up
44.3 mln from a year ago. Provision for loan losses in the
third quarter was 20 mln dlrs versis 40 mln a year previously.
    At September 30, the provision for loan losses jumped to
1.30 billion dlrs from 455 mln at the same time last year.

share prices crashed in the U.S., The region's main trading

    Panic spread through Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South
Korea following the collapse on Wall Street.
    Officials in Hong Kong, worried that the notoriously
volatile market would go wild, suspended trading until next

    Seoul's composite index lost over 11 points by late morning
to 505.28, with investors worried about a possible rise in oil
prices after U.S. Attacks on Iranian oil platforms in the Gulf.
    ""When the U.S. Catches cold, Taiwan sneezes,"" said general

this case, Taiwan has got pneumonia.""

<TITLE>JAPAN TRIES TO STEM STOCKS DIVE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Government and monetary authorities today
staged a concerted effort to calm spreading panic on Japanese
stock exchanges but market analysts said there were limits to
their ability to succeed.
    ""The ability of the Big Four (Japanese securities houses)
and the Finance Ministry is limited,"" said Barclays de Zoete
Wedd economist Peter Morgan.
    Finance Ministry officials asked the big four securities
companies this afternoon to help calm panic selling on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, ministry officials said.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was quoted by Kyodo News
Service as saying he was watching the stock market situation.
    But he rejected comparisons with the 1929 stock market
collapse and subsequent recession.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock
market should not be gravely affected by downturns in New York
and London because there are clear signs of a Japanese economic
recovery and exchange rate stability.
    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita also tried to calm
the panic, saying in a statement that world stock markets were
excessively concerned about the economic future.
    Traditionally, the four big houses  -- Nomura Securities Co
Ltd, Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd, Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, and
Nikko Securities Co Ltd -- have influenced the market because
of their sheer size and overwhelming market share.
    This strength has in the past made it possible for the
brokerages to calm down markets under guidance from the Finance
Ministry, analysts said.
    But the analysts questioned whether the brokerages, which
have already suffered heavy losses from falling bond markets
over the past year, would have the strength this time to turn
things around.
    ""The question is, are the Japanese brokerages strong enough
to force investors to buy,"" said Johsen Takahashi, research
director at the Mitsubishi Research Institute.
    ""If we consider that they have suffered serious losses in
the bond markets and in their U.S. Investments, it is debatable
whether they they could support buying,"" he said.
    ""We can support things to some extent, but we can't
completely suppress selling,"" said one Japanese broker.
    Some analysts said the high percentage of shares cross-held
by financial institutions and other corporations could have a
stabilising effect on the market.
    Some 80 pct of shares are held by corporate shareholders,
said Keikichi Honda, general manager of the Bank of Tokyo Ltd's
economic research division. ""This is a tightly woven textile. In
its own way it is stronger than Wall Street.""
    But other analysts expressed doubt about this argument.
    ""If a high percent of shares is cross held, everything
happens at the edges and the relative moves can be larger,"" said
Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson. ""Selling
will drive prices down an enormous distance because of no
liquidity.""
    ""You don't need big volume to get big declines in the market
-- you just need a huge imbalance between sellers and buyers,""
said Barclay's Morgan.
    Shares held by what are termed ""stable shareholders,"" or
banks and other companies with which a firm does business,
might also find their way onto the market if the outlook gets
bad enough, some analsyst said.
    ""Closely held shares could become unclosely held,"" said
Morgan. But he said such a prospect is unlikely right now
because companies, with their improved earnings prospects, do
not need to sell shares for cash flow reasons.

<TITLE>WORLD COULD COPE WITH HORMUZ CLOSURE, SUBROTO SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Oil prices would skyrocket for a time if
conflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz, but oil
supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand,
Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.
    He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military
action in the Gulf.
    But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian
Petroleum Association, he said, ""If worst comes to worst and say
the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely
shut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust,
can take care of the situation.""
    ""But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short
duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of
the situation,"" he declared.
    Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively
short-term impact on prices, he added.
    Assessing future price trends, he said, ""Short-term spot
prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely
hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per
barrel.
    ""The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater
than the downward ones.""
    ""The balance between supply and demand in the short term
will still be delicate,"" he added. ""Non-Opec production may still
go up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increase
in world demand.""
    Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which
has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play
havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the
situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.
    In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a
plateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, he
said.

<DATELINE>    NICOSIA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran's top war spokesman Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday called the U.S. Attacks on two of
its Gulf oil platforms an escalation and promised retaliation.
    ""God willing, we will carry out our duty in the coming days
and make them sorry,"" said Rafsanjani in a speech to Parliament
later broadcast by Tehran Radio.
    The Tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance
after the U.S. Raids on the rigs, one of which was destroyed.
    President Ali Khamenei, Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi
and now Rafsanjani within 24 hours of the U.S. Action have all

    Rafsanjani, the parliamentary speaker, said, ""It is not a
threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will
respond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved it
in practice."" He added that the American attack ""squares neither
with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with
security, nor reason and wisdom.""
    U.S. Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform and
American special forces boarded another, destroying equipment.
    The U.S. Government said the attack was a measured response
to an Iranian missile attack on the American-flagged Kuwaiti

<TITLE>LYNG PLEASED EC TO OFFER GATT FARM PROPOSAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a
global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the
United States opposes key parts of the proposal.
    ""We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.
It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,"" Lyng
told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.
    Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg
endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.
The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay
round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.
    Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan
seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing
curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.
    The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all
farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has
pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching
a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.
    However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the
Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is
unrealistic.
    Asked about such criticism, Lyng said ""The alternative to
doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I
think that is the unrealistic position.""
    ""I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are
trying to say.""
    Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a
freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations 
started.
    ""All that some countries would like to have would be a
wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.
That doesn't do a thing for us,"" Lyng said.
    The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of
agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he
said.
    At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is
expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.
    The United States will be represented at the meeting by
former agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, recently
appointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture.

<TITLE>BETHLEHEM STEEL &lt;BS> SETS STEEL PRICE INCREASES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BETHLEHEM, Pa., Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bethlehem Steel Corp said prices
for steel sheet products will be increased up to 30 dlrs a ton
effective January 3.
    The increases will affect certain non-contract or spot
transactions and will be achieved through reductions in
competitive discounts.
    The company said transaction prices for contract accounts,
which have a duration of six months or more, will also be
increased to commensurate levels.
    Percentage increases were not immediately available.
    Prices for flat-rolled steel sheet, used in automobiles,
appliances and other products, vary widely between about 350
and 800 dlrs a ton.
    The company said it was taking the actions to restore sheet
transaction prices to more equitable levels. In many cases,
prices are still lower than those attained in 1984, it said.
    Bethlehem also said that in response to changing market
conditions and potential inflationary pressures, efforts will
be made to mininize the number and the duration of firm price
contracts.

Corp said 1987 12 month earnings will be lower than the
earnings of 300.8 mln dlrs on revenues of 3.77 billion dlrs it
reported for 1986.
    The company cited a one-time write-off of its investment in
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp secondary
reserve, a one-time higher federal tax rate, reduced loan sale
volume, and the effect of rising short-term rates on margins as
reasons for the expected decline.
    In addition, the company cited a net-after tax loss of 2.4
mln dlrs from its leasing operation during the 1987 nine mth
period as a reason for the anticipated earnings drop.
    Earlier today, the financial services company reported
earnings of 57.8 mln dlrs for the third quarter of 1987

<TITLE>TOYOTA &lt;TOYO.T> SEES LOWER U.S. SALES IN 1988</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Toyota Motor Co expects its U.S. vehicle
sales in 1988 will decline to about 875,000 cars and trucks
from roughly 930,000 expected in 1987, a senior exeuctive said.
    Jim Perkins, group vice president for sales and marketing
for Toyota's U.S. sales subsidiary, told reporters Toyota's
expected decline will come principally in the truck segment
where the company faces intense competition from U.S. domestic
manufacturers such as Ford Motor Co &lt;F>.
    Toyota, he said, also expects to stress sales in the low
and middle segments of the car market to remain competitive.
    Asked if Toyota's U.S. profits could show a substantial
decline with its lower trucks sales in the next two years, he
responded ""conceivably it could,"" but added, ""Our plan is not
to chase this thing to where it makes no economic sense.""
    Perkins also predicted that the 1988 U.S. vehicle market
could fall below 15 mln sales from above 15 mln expected this
year. He expects some smaller Japanese automakers could be
forced to withdraw from the U.S. market or to seek partnerships
with one another in the face of intense competition.
     The Toyota executive said the collapse of U.S. stock
prices and any further weakening of the dollar would likely
have ""a very quick impact on the Japanese (car) companies.""
    ""In our company, when the stock market goes down, we see it
very soon in the New York metropolitan car market. New York is
the best indicator of what's going to happen in the rest of of
the country. I can tell you from the next 15 days (of car
sales) in the New York market what it will be in the rest of
the country in the next six months,"" Perkins said.
     The Toyota executive said the panic selloff in the New
York Stock Exchange hurts the car market because ""it does
create a shock wave of doubt in the minds of consumers.""
     He said Toyota would wait at least 30 to 60 days to assess
the impact of the the stock market drop on the wider economy
before making any changes in its basic business plan for the
U.S. market.
    Toyota, he said, expects its 1988 U.S. sales will total at
least 600,000 cars and 275,000 trucks compared with about
630,000 cars and 300,000 trucks expected for 1987, and 644,000
cars and 388,000 trucks sold in 1986.
    He said Toyota hopes it will be able to import 610,000 cars
from Japan in 1988, the same as its 1987 allocation under
Tokyo's voluntary export restraint scheme.
    But he said it was uncertain if Toyota would keep its
current allocation becuase of pressures on Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry to roll back Japanese car
export quotas from the current 2.3 mln annualized rate.

<TITLE>IBC SEEKS EXPORT DETAILS TO SET COFFEE QUOTAS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Brazilian Coffee Institute
(IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to
submit details of past export performance in order that
individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said.
    He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed
acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals
to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export
performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.
    Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive
months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be
used for calculating the export performace portion.
    The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers
participation and use this as a basis for allocation of
individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.
    He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo
Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate.
Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable
on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this
premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export
sales declaration form.
    Auctions will not start until after the opening of export
registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be
but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of
the week, opening registraions from Monday.
    A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the
CNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system for
allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels,
the spokesman added.
    A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished
in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure
shipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota.

<TITLE>COPA URGES TAX ON VEGETABLE PROTEINS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community's farmers'
pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax
on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax
which has already been proposed by the EC Commission.
    Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on
Tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism
for cereal substitutes.
    He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the
Danish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair
meetings of their EC colleagues.
    Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help
the EC's budget problems and would provide some price stability
for producers.
    This would in turn help the market position for certain
crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas
and beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe
output restrictions.
    A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax
on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats
succeeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC
price fixing.
    However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its
proposals for a tax.
    Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue
international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of
bridging the gap between EC and world prices.

<TITLE>POEHL SAYS RATE RISES ARE CAUSE FOR CONCERN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rises in West German and international
interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has
no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl said.
    ""We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred
here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,""
Poehl told an investment conference.
    ""I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest
in higher capital market rates,"" he said.
    Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a
tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80
pct.
    Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have
seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct
at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in
late September.
    The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to
3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections
of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.
    These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting
between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.
    Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed
their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.
    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in
West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the
dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.
    But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in
nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.
    Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not
due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and
currency developments.
    Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said ""You
have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a
policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears.""
 The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he
said.
    Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,
saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to
international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.
    The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money
supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.
    ""Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of
1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest
rates have risen substantially more,"" Poehl said.
    This had to be taken into account when considering recent
rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to
rising international money market rates that had spilled over
into the German market, he said.
    Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far
ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.
    ""The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is
definitely underway,"" he said, noting that this was not so
noticeable in absolute figures.
    The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also
attracted little attention, he said.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs said he
sold the stake he held in Gillette Co &lt;GS> after deciding that
he could not force Gillette to accept a 47 dlr a share takeover
bid made by Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV>.
    Revlon's bid expired last week after being repeatedly
rejected by Gillette. Jacobs had earlier considered waging a
proxy fight over Gillette.
    Jacobs told Reuters he sold the Gillette stake, which he
called ""substantial"" but under five pct, a few weeks ago over a
period of several days. He said he sold the stock at a profit,
but did not disclose the selling price.
    Gillette's stock was at 24-1/8, up 1/8, in morning trade,
off the high of 45-7/8 reached after Revlon announced its bid.
    Jacobs said he sold his Gillette stake based on an
""investment decision. I surely did not see this happening,"" he
said of Monday's stock market free-fall.
    A Gillette spokesman said the mpany had no comment.
    Jacobs said he and fellow investor Carl Pohlad continue to
hold a stake in Allegheny International Inc &lt;AG>. In August

that they had acquired 854,900 shares, or 7.9 pct, of Allegheny

    The union has threatened to strike at 1000 hrs EDT (1400

<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson said the severity of the current rout on world stock
markets was an absurd over-reaction sparked on Wall Street by a
spreading lack of confidence in the U.S. Economy.
    Lawson said in a BBC radio interview, ""This began on Wall
Street. It has a lot to do with the American stock market (and)
a lack of confidence in the U.S. -  and some careless talk by
those who should have known better.""
    In a further wave of selling this morning in London, the
FTSE 100 index had lost a further 233.2 points only 50 minutes
after the official 0800 GMT opening to stand at 1,819.1.
    Lawson said a correction on world stock markets was to have
been expected after the bull markets of recent years. ""What was
not expected was the severity of the downturn, which quite
frankly is rather absurd.""
    He said he saw no fundamental signs why the U.S. Economy
should go into recession, adding, ""Indeed the possibility of
higher (U.S.) interest rates would certainly in my judgment not
lead the American economy into a recession.""
    ""The only way in which the American economy would go into
recession was if it actually talks itself into recession,"" he
said.

<TITLE>PHILIPPINES APPLAUDS DEFEAT OF U.S. LABELLING BILL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Diane Stormont</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Philippine coconut industry has
greeted with relief the defeat in the U.S. Senate of a bill
requiring some edible oils to be labelled as saturated fats.
    The bill, which was defeated by the Senate Agriculture
Committee on Monday, could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a year
in lost exports, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said.
    ""Naturally, we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance the
bill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to another
Senate bill,"" a spokesman for the United Coconut Association of
the Philippines (UCAP).
    PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close, with
eight senators voting for it, 10 against and one abstaining.
    The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association
(ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill.
    He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue during
the debate.
    ""Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturated
animal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systems
leaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease,"" he said.
    U.S. Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued that
saturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels would
discourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favour
of domestic unsaturated alternatives.
    Opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminated
against imports and would damage the Philippines, Malaysia and
Indonesia.
    The Philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut products
in 1986, up from 477 mln in 1985, UCAP figures show.
    Exports to the United States for edible and non-edible use
account for about half of that total, PCA's Romero said.

<TITLE>GATT CASE AGAINST JAPAN A MODEL FOR U.S. - LYNG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
said the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint
against Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance in
negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.
    The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan
end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the
end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will
favor the U.S.
    ""These are quota items, and the principles that apply to
them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of
whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus,"" Lyng
told Reuters in an interview.
    He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on
beef and citrus after March 31, next year.
    The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United
States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some
cheeses and specialty fruit juices.
    U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would
be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has
been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.
    The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus
quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect
Japanese farmers.
    ""We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on
beef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an
illegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.
    He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next
April if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands.

<DATELINE>    COLOGNE, West Germany, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Monday's international
share crash was exaggerated and did not reflect economic
fundamentals, Wolfgang Roeller, president of the West German
banking association BDB said in a statement.
    ""A comparison with the (Wall Street crash of) 1929 is
totally inappropriate,"" Roeller, also chief executive of
Dresdner Bank AG, said.
    The world economy was growing and dangers of inflation were
being held in check. The recent International Monetary Fund and
World meetings confirmed the positive forecasts for global
economic development.
    Therefore, there were no rational reasons for a sharp
tightening of monetary policy nor for a continued rise in
interest rates, Roeller said.
    ""This applies in particular to West Germany,"" he said.
    As a result, Roeller expected the markets to calm. They
would not ignore long-term economic factors.
    International cooperation on currencies established by the
Louvre accord and strengthened by Monday's meeting between U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker, West German Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl,

<AUTHOR>    By Vithoon Amorn</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thai stock prices plunged on Tuesday as
nervous investors unloaded shares on reports of steep declines
on major world stock markets.
    Brokers said the Securities Exchange of Thailand Index fell
a record 36.64 points, or nearly eight pct, to close at 422.37.
    ""It's impossible to halt the slide in this situation. The
market just doesn't behave logically,"" said Sirivat
Voravetvuthikun, executive vice president of Asian Securities
Trading Co Ltd.
    But Sirivat said he did not believe the fall would mark the
end of the SET's 16 month bull run, which has accelerated
during the last two months. He expected Thai stocks to
fluctuate widely in the next few weeks.
    The slide on Tuesday followed a 13.85 point decline of the
97-stock index on Monday when it closed at 459.01.
    Brokers said they were flooded with sell orders when the
market opened this morning and a SET announcement urging
investors not to panic was ignored.
    The index reached a record 472.86 last Friday, up 57.7 pct
from end-June and 128.2 pct higher than last December.
    SET officials said 77 issues were traded on Tuesday, of
which all but two declined. Of the losers, 68 plummeted the
daily maximum 10 pct allowed by the exchange. Prices on the
special foreign column also fell sharply.
    SET vice president Suthichai Chitvanich told reporters the
10 pct floor serves as a restraint, making it unnecessary to
suspend trading should the panic continue.
    The Thai exchange has lately been gaining on its own
strength with most buying coming from local investors.
    Investors should not be unduly influenced by foreign market
reports, he added.
    Suthichai said sound local fundamentals, including low
interest rates and promising economic growth, favoured
investment in the stock market.
    The SET also announced it would release third quarter
corporate earnings earlier than expected as part of efforts to
shore up public confidence.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> CANADA AND WORKERS FAR APART IN TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian unit of General Motors Corp
and the union representing its 40,000 workers remain far apart
over local issues in contract talks two days from a threatened
strike, a union spokesman said.
    The deepest divisions appeared to be between General Motors
of Canada Ltd and the Canadian Auto Workers local representing
17,000 workers at an assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, union
spokesman Wendy Cuthbertson said.
    ""Local 222 is miles apart,"" said Cuthbertson. The local
assembles full-size pick-up trucks, the Buick Regal and the
Pontiac 6000.
    Local issues there included shift schedules, transfers and
working conditions, union president Bob White said.
    The union has threatened to strike at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT on
Thursday unless it has reached a tentative settlement.
    Bargaining was scheduled to continue late into Tuesday
night in an effort to avert a walkout, said Cuthbertson.
    On Monday, the union accepted an economic offer from GM
Canada that largely matched the pay-and-benefit pattern reached
earlier at Chrysler Corp &lt;C> and Ford Motor Co &lt;F> units.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's highest court has decided the
International Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITC
documents in court actions.
    On November 2 the House of Lords will decide if and to what
extent ITC documents, whether circulated or not, are admissible
as court evidence. Lawyers working in the legal tangle left
from the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said this
hearing is likely to last a few days.
    On Wednesday the Court of Appeal will link the outstanding
ITC cases that have so far reached it and a single set of
hearings could begin in early January, they added.
    The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents will
be referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companies
against the London Metal Exchange although the underlying case
is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988.
    The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers

<TITLE>ASA SAYS EC OILSEED POLICY ILLEGAL UNDER GATT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>        LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The American Soybean Association (ASA)
denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and
threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not
remedy the situation.
    ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored
Outlook 87 conference: ""It will be filed unless the EC takes
drastic and immediate steps.""
    ""These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,
since they were established after the zero soybean duty was
established in 1962,"" he said.
    The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask
for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to
make the regime non-discriminatory.
    The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in
an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production
has risen dramatically since then.
    The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world
market levels and is considering implementing a controversial
oils and fats tax.
    The subsidies ""are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero
duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,"" Adams
said.
    The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its
trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an
EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the
EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.
    U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in
volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of
EC policies, Adams added.
    Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at
the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973
when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.

<TITLE>TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent
the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even
force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,
government and private economists said.
    A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark
further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major
deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.
    Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently
maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount
rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. 
    Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the
central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance
higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.
    But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15
pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to
raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a
renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.
    Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the
markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded
the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount
rate increase.
    A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.
And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a
further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. ""They need to
support the stock and security markets,"" he said.
    But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change
policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central
bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices
continue to plunge during the rest of the week.
    Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the
economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary
impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.
    With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in
stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and
business confidence, one government economist said.
    ""There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't
be that big,"" said another.
    Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their
own, although they do participate through trust funds and other
investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned
to financial market investments for profits during last year's
economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to
refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.
    Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is
partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have
shifted funds away from financial investments to increase
inventories and step up capital spending, one government
economist said.
    In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price
drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices
will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a
greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,
one central bank official said. ""That will at least take a
couple of days, if not weeks,"" he said.

<TITLE>U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lisa Vaughan</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States is prepared to ""pull out
all the stops"" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador
to GATT Michael Samuels said.
    Those rights are now being challenged by the European
Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a
conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.
    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if
the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without
the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.
    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect
on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat
shipments into the EC.
    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.
trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed
prices over the current market level and which may be extended
to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.
    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,
an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade
negotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to be
erected,"" Samuels said.
    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm
subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary""
and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it is
unrealistic.
    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal
on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally
next week.
    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce
tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals
substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of
farm subsidies.
    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as
they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major
trade distortions, Samuels said.
    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally
submitted and respond to it officially then.
    ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este
declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""
the U.S. Ambassador said.
    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores
the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.
    The key difference between the two approaches is that the
U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing
only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.
    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,
there would be little incentive for the Community to work to
correct the international trade situation, he added.
    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC
oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to
third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the
U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

    Several hours later, the Pentagon announced that U.S.

<TITLE>LYNG DEFENDS U.S. EXPORT SUBSIDY PROGRAM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said the United States will continue its policy of
subsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there is
a global agreement to end such subsidies.
    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he was
troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program
(EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exports
that the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it.
    ""Yes, I'm troubled with that a little bit,"" he said. ""There's
no question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow,
the longer it is to wean it.""
    In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growing
list of commodities to an increasing number of countries.
    Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies
""just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy"" and said he saw an
end to the expansion of the EEP.
    ""I'm sure there's an end to the expansion, but we are doing
this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that
we've lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those,
particularly the European Community, who, we are convinced, are
the worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization, that
we are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to
some agreement to put an end to it,"" he said.

<TITLE>AQUINO SAYS GROWTH HAS PRIORITY OVER DEBT PAYMENTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MANILA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Corazon Aquino said economic
growth took priority over debt repayments but she sought to
dispel fears that the Philippines would not honour a July
agreement rescheduling 13.2 billion dlrs of debt.
    In a speech to 13 major business groups, Aquino said, ""Our
policy has been very clear fm the start -- growth must take
priority, for the plain and simple reason that if we have no
money to pay, we can't. And if we starve the nation of
essential services, there may be no one around to honour the
debt.""
    Aquino said her officials would try to get all 483 creditor
banks to sign the debt rescheduling pact by the November 15
effective date.
    ""That should end speculation and remove at least one excuse
for hoarding dollars,"" Aquino said.
    Violent fluctuations in the peso's exchange rate and the
end of a 17-month bull run in local stock markets have
triggered dollar-hoarding.
    Aquino said the country's foreign debt, which rose to
nearly 29 billion dlrs in April, was growing even without fresh
borrowing.
    Debt servicing took up 40 pct of the budget and 45 pct of
export earnings, Aquino said. Over the next six years, the
Philippines would be paying its creditors 20 billion dlrs while
getting only four billion dlrs in new loans.
    Aquino acknowledged there were grave doubts about her
government's ambitious privatisation program.
    ""There is always an excuse for government not to sell,"" she
said, but she added: ""I want government to get out of business.""
She said non-performing assets would be sold in open bidding
and Filipinos and foreigners would compete on equal terms.

<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Soviet oil production target for 1988
has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over
this year's planned output.
    Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday
at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.
    He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil
deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an
upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation
which began in late 1983.
    Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil,
slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.
    January-September figures released at the weekend showed
Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467
mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million.
    Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil
deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog
prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.
    The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988
budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday.

<TITLE>AHMANSON &lt;AHM> NET LOWER ON LOAN SALE DECLINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>H.F. Ahmanson and Co, parent of Home
Savings of America, said its third quarter earnings declined as
a result of its decision in the second quarter to curtail sales
of loans and mortgage-backed securities.
    As a result, after-tax gains on sales of loans and
mortgage-backed securities accounted for 28 pct of its third
quarter net, compared to 82 pct in last year's third quarter.
    The company reported third quarter income of 40.3 mln dlrs,
or 41 cts per share, down from 78.9 mln dlrs, or 80 cts per
share, a year ago.
   
    The company said third qurter loan sales totaled 366 mln
dlrs, inlcuding 290 mln dlrs of adjustable rate mortgage
instruments, generating after-tax gains of 11.2 mln dlrs. This
compares with year ago loan sales of 2.29 billion dlrs,
generating after-tax gains of 65.1 mln dlrs.
    Third quarter loan originations totaled a record 3.48
billion dlrs, up 29 pct frrm 2.69 billion dlrs a year ago,
reflecting record loan fundings and the reduced loan sales.
    Ahmanson said monthly adjustable rate loans accounted for
85.8 pct of the real estate loans and mortgage-backed
securities, up from 77.6 pct a year ago.

<TITLE>BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Felix Dearden</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BONN, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States appears to have won a
transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest
rates, European economists said.
    But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing
the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were
plunging.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to
currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,
according to official statements released late Monday.
    Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the
Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks
liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct
facility rate offered last week.
    While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank
president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added
money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a
strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.
     ""It's round one to the Americans, "" said Richard Reid,
senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in
London.
    But Reid added, ""We shouldn't forget that it has taken one
of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West
Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05
percentage point.""
    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening
of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and
fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.
    Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's
Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary
policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -
the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
    The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets
and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading
in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was
quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.
    Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche
Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world
stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West
German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.
    ""The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market
losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits
with Baker's wishes, then all the better,"" he said.
    No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the
Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises
in the U.S., Aschoff said.
    Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central
bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he
thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.
    Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston
Ltd in London said ""The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat
and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the
security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was
before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.""
    Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was
reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity
at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.
    Economists said the United States now appeared to have
agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support
the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.
    Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder
Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg
told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule
out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening
on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.
    Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West
Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency
stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central
banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them
to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.

    In an effort to reduce the volatility in the market today,
the NYSE temporarily suspended trading on the New York Futures
Exchange. The NYFE reopened at 1315 EDT.
    The NYSE said the reason for the suspension was that they

the billion dlr lawsuit reportedly stalled earlier this year
when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a friend
of the court brief in support of Texaco.
    The agency claimed Pennzoil violated SEC rule 10B-13 which
prohibits the purchase of shares privately at the same time a
tender offer is outstanding.
    DeCrane also said concerns expressed by 19 state attorneys
general in the legal proceedings also favored Texaco's
position.
    ""The bottom line is that the SEC had intervened to insure
that its rule are interpreted properly in the interest of
millions of private stockholders around the country who might
some day find themselves the victim of this same kind of
manipulation,"" DeCrane told the oilmen.
    He warned that if the state appeals court judgment was
upheld in Pennzoil's favor, it would ""send out of state
businesses fleeing from Texas in droves.""
    Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
bankruptcy code last April after a state appeals court upheld
Pennzoil's 10.3 billion dlr judgment.
   
    Texaco's appeal of the decision to the Texas State Supreme
Court has been pending for several weeks and the court is
expected to decide soon whether it will agree to review the
lower court ruling.
    If the Texas State Supreme Court does not hear the case,
Texaco has said it will take its case to the U.S. Supreme
Court.

<TITLE>EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) agreed a
trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country
following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC
officials said.
    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina
will gain additional trading rights on a series of products
including meat, fish and cereals by-products.
    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with
Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the
officials said.
    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC
states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased
quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.
    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,
saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals
substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the
officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from
improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the
quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500
tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will
be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.
    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of
5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced
levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.
    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said
that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their
exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They
have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade).
    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve
Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had
been affected by the country's EC membership.
    Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the
fish dispute with Canada.
    Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC
claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has
improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied
with Japanese offers of compensation.
    Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on
citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some
other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear
and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.
    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told
journalists: ""We maintain our position that the (Japanese)
concessions were not enough.""
    ""We hope that there will be an improvement,"" he said.

    The Tokyo market was 14.9 pct off last night after a huge

    The Stock Exchange said although the Stock Exchange
Automated Quotation (SEAQ) system was working perfectly, ""fast

    A ""fast market"" indicator is displayed at the bottom of the
SEAQ screen when the huge volume of activity is delaying prices
from entering the system, making screen prices lag behind the
prevailing market.
    Such conditions are reviewed every 30 minutes and at 1000
GMT were withdrawn and all on screen prices became firm.
    The Exchange said the mandatory quote period will still end
at 1600 GMT but depending upon trading activity the market

<DATELINE>    OSLO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Den Norske Creditbank (DNC) &lt;NCBO.OL>,
Norway's biggest commercial bank, said it boosted its profits
in 1987's first eight months by 32.3 pct after vigorously
cutting loan losses and operating costs.
    The bank showed a 300 mln crown net profit after provisions
for losses and taxes in the period ending on August 31, against
a 203 mln crown profit in the same year-ago period, it said.
    DNC's biggest gains were seen in the domestic market, but
some of its foreign exchange and securities units have been hit
by sharply higher interest rates for the dollar and results
remained unsatisfactory, it added.
    Total assets rose to 132 billion crowns from 107.6 billion.
    Although the group's operating profit dropped to 875 mln
crowns compared with 986 mln a year-ago, the loss was countered
by reducing the need to set aside capital to cover loan losses,
it added.
    ""In 1986 DNC made substantial provisions for potential loan
losses, particularly in the oil and shipping sectors...The need
for write-offs in these sectors has now been substantially
reduced,"" the bank said.
    DNC, with extensive exposure in the oil industry, was hard

earned 129.1 mln dlrs for the third quarter, up from 105.8 mln
a year earlier.
    Net income per common share rose to 2.73 dlrs from 2.29
dlrs.
    Manufacturers Hanover said it raised common shareholders'
equity at the end of the third quarter from the second quarter
by 347 mln dlrs, to 2.09 billion dlrs. Included in the increase
was 267 mln dlrs from the sale last month of 6.9 mln new shares
of the corporation's common stock, and 76 mln dlrs from
retained earnings.
   
    Primary capital grew to 6.2 billion dlrs, or 7.92 pct of
total assets, up from 5.3 billion dlrs, or 7.07 pct, a year
earlier.
    Provisions for possible loans losses in the third quarter
was 111.9 mln dlrs, down from 139.5 mln a year ago. The reserve
for loan losses stood at 4.78 pct of total loans at the end of
September, up from 1.72 pct a year earlier.
    ""We have placed top priority on the restoration of
shareholders' equity in the shortest time frame possible,"" said
John McGillicuddy, chairman and chief executive.
    ""The first step was selling the full amount of new common
equity we anticipate needing in this replenishment process,""
McGillicuddy added. ""The remainder will come from higher core
earnings, the sale of undervalued, non-strategic assets and the
recognition of tax benefits.""
    Taken together, he said, these moves, as well as tighter
control over asset levels, will raise the corporation's common
equity-to-assets ratio to the four-pct range by the end of
1988. The ratio was 2.77 pct on September 30.
    For the nine months, Manufacturers reported a net loss of
1.16 billion dlrs, down from a gain of 301.8 mln a year ago.
    On a per-share basis, the loss was 28.33 dlrs, down from a
gain of 6.42 dlrs.
    The nine-month results reflect the impact of a previously
announced decision last quarter to boost the corporation's
loan-loss reserves by 1.7 billion dlrs. Without the addition,
net income would have been 263.3 mln dlrs, or 5.41 a share.
    Net interest revenue on a taxable equivalent basis in the
third quarter was 494.2 mln dlrs, down from 546.4 mln.
    Non-interest expenses in the latest quarter rose to 571.0
mln dlrs from 541.8 mln. Total capital at September 30 rose to

    The company is part of Montenay S.A, a subsidiary of

    It said county commissions ratified the contract which
calls for investment of 45 mln dlrs to refurbish the plant and

    Montenay said the agreement allows Dade County to maintain
its disposal fee at 27 dlrs per ton, by far the lowest of all
counties involved in resource recovery in Florida.
    The company said it will receive 22 dlrs per ton of refuse

<TITLE>MEXICAN STOCKMARKET HEAD SEES NO CRISIS AFTER FALL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MEXICO CITY, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The outlook for Mexico's economy and
stockmarket remains optimistic despite the market's worst-ever
fall of 52,671.56 points on Monday, the president of the
Mexican stock exchange, Manuel Somoza, said.
    He said the 16.51 pct drop in the exchange's index
reflected a ""totally emotional"" reaction to Monday's fall on the
New York stock exchange and was not a reflection of a new
crisis for the Mexican economy or the stockmarket.""
    He was speaking at a news conference here on Monday.
    ""We think that after the psycological effect the market will
tend to stabilize itself,"" Somoza said.
    Somoza said he based his optimism on the relatively bright
outlook of the Mexican economy due to increased income from oil
and non-petroleum exports, record high foreign reserves and
government efforts to promote a modernization of the industrial
sector.
    ""The U.S. Economy is not the same as the Mexican,"" he said.
He did not say when he thought the market would stabilize.
    He said traders had originally expected the market to level
out on Monday after last week's profit taking pulled the index
down 44,207 points. 
    News of the ""enormous problems"" in New York, which reached
Mexico City before the local market opened, caused a flurry of
selling on the Mexican exchange, Somoza said.
    The stockmarket had risen 629 pct over the year by the end
of September.
    Somoza said Monday's light volume of 15.3 mln shares
compared to an average of 53 mln was an indication the day's
drop was not a sign of a major collapse.
    He also denied rumours that the day's loss was the result
of government and brokerage house manipulation.

<TITLE>EAST, WEST APPROVE NUCLEAR FUSION ENERGY PROJECT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VIENNA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>East and West on Monday decided to go
ahead with an ambitious nuclear fusion project billed as
possibly providing an inexhaustible source of energy, the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said.
    Representatives of the U.S., The Soviet Union, the European
Community and Japan agreed to develop plans for a revolutionary
thermonuclear reactor, to produce energy not from splitting
atoms as in today's nuclear plants, but by joining them.
    Work is due to begin next year at the Institute for Plasma
Physics at the Max Planck Foundation near Munich, West Germany,
and is scheduled for completion by 1990, an IAEA statement
said.
    Research into fusion's scientific feasibility has been
under way for many years but the project approved on Monday,
known as International Thremonuclear Experimental Reactor
(ITER) will study if an actual plant could be built.
    The project represents an unprecedented display of
East-West scientific cooperation, but a decision will not be
made until its completion on whether an actual reactor would be
jointly constructed or by individual participant countries.
    Dieter Sigmar, a leading U.S. Fusion researcher, said last
month that the development of a demonstration plant would cost
several billion dlrs and need at least another 10 years.
    Fusion plants would produce little radioactive waste.
    While today's nuclear power plants need uranium, mined in
only a few countries and producing dangerous waste, fusion
plants would eventually run only on deuterium, an element
related to hydrogen and available from almost limitless
supplies of sea water, according to experts.

<TITLE>TAKESHITA FACES TOUGH ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT JOB</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Tsukasa Maekawa</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita,
chosen on Monday to be Japan's next prime minister, will face a
tough test in managing Japan's economy from the very start of
his two-year term, economists and businessmen said.
    Takeshita told a news conference on Tuesday that he would
do his best to continue the domestic reforms and external
policies of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
    However, leading Japanese businessmen called on Takeshita
to outdo Nakasone by showing stronger leadership.
    ""Takeshita should not merely follow the Nakasone policies
but should cope with mounting economic issues with a new vision
and policies,"" Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee
for Economic Development, said in a statement.
    Economists generally agreed that there will be no major
changes in Japan's economic policies under a new leader.
    However, expectations are high among major industries for
new initiatives by Takeshita for immediate and effective
measures to solve economic problems such as trade friction with
the U.S., Administrative and tax reforms, and soaring land
prices.
    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organisations (Keidanren), urged Takeshita to succeed in
unifying the ruling Liberal Democratic Party as soon as
possible to tackle difficult tasks.
    Regarding foreign economic polices, Yoshitoki Chino,
chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers Association, said
Takeshita should come up with economic measures well before
economic issues develop into problems.
    Behind those calls on Takeshita for prompt action are
doubts about his capability in handling international issues
due to his lack of experience in diplomacy, economists said.
     Economists said foreign countries should be patient with
Takeshita, who is widely known as an ultra-cautious politician.
    Takeshita has repeatedly said, ""There should be consensus
before taking action.""
    Takeshita has so far failed to unveil specific measures to
reduce Japan's huge trade surplus, economists said.
    He has said Japan will continue to stimulate the economy
and to open the market wider to foreign products.

<TITLE>STOCK TUMBLE MAY SCARE RETIREES OUT OR MARKET</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Kiernan</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Many Florida investors are old enough to
have seen it all before -- they lived through the Crash of '29
and Monday's stock market debacle was just another day for
some.
    ""I don't sell,"" declared one elderly investor, who said he
had more than one mln dlrs in stocks. ""Whatever goes down is
bound to come back up.""
    The uniqueness of south Florida investors was easy to see
in brokerage offices around Miami, where the average age of the
crowds watching the Big Board quotations flash by on Tuesday
was retirement and beyond.
   
    ""I don't know of any demographic studies, but we certainly
have the highest number of elderly active investors,"" said
Marshall Moore, a vice president of AmeriFirst Securities
Corporation in Miami.
    He worries that Monday's record loss of more than 500
points on the New York Stock Exchange will scare many people,
particularly those on fixed incomes, out of the market forever.
    ""They will not be in stocks any longer,"" he said. ""When you
start getting heart palpitations and sweaty palms you have to
get out and stay out except for maybe utilities and some
income-oriented issues.""
   
    Across the state on the Gulf coast where there are heavy
concentrations of retired persons, Robert Lee of Investment
Management and Research Incorporated said there were ""a lot of
serious losses out there.""
    Retirees account for 90 per cent of his firm's business and
could take comfort in the fact that its professional managers
took their money out of the market last month. ""But for those
who were buying in on the recent  upswing, this is devastating,""
he said.
   
    Miami Beach broker George Fox, most of whose clients are
over 60, worries that many are not taking the situation
seriously enough. Those who depend on their market earnings
should be a lot more concerned, he said. ""I am scared because I
think this could become very serious.""
    One 93-year-old investor said the market was bound to fall
sharply, ""I just didn't think it would happen so soon."" She
remembered '29 and said she remained stingy to this day as a
result. ""I still find it hard to spend money.""

<TITLE>JAPANESE STOCK PLUNGE RAISES FUNDING PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By James Kynge</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The massive plunge in Tokyo stock prices on
Tuesday could rob the Government of much-needed revenue to spur
Japan's economy, and may hurt banks' ability to lend abroad,
analysts polled by Reuters said.
    ""The Japanese Government is depending on the sale of NTT
(Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp &lt;NCCT.T>) shares for much
of its public spending budget,"" said Shigeo Suzuki, a deputy
general manager at the Industrial Bank of Japan.
    Japan had hoped to raise at least 5,000 billion yen from
the sale of 1.95 mln NTT shares on November 10.
    However, the 14.9 pct plunge in the Tokyo share index today
has made such plans look unrealistic, analysts said.
    ""The government could defer the sale of NTT or they could
offer fewer shares,"" said Keikichi Honda, general manager of
economic research at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
    Honda said another possibility is that the underwriters
handling the NTT sale would have to pay the Government the
amount it expected to get and bear the brunt of any losses
themselves. ""That is what underwriting means,"" he added.
    A Finance Ministry official confirmed that the government
planned to go ahead with its sale of NTT shares on November 10.
    Another possible effect of Tokyo's stock tumble would be to
seriously undermine the asset base of Japanese banks.
    The banks lend money all over the world and regard the
market value of stock holdings as assets, analysts said.
    ""Japanese banks make loans using perhaps as much as 60 to 70
pct of the market value of their unrealised stock holdings as
assets,"" said Industrial Bank's Suzuki.
    There is also concern that Japanese companies, which have
invested heavily in Tokyo's stocks as their real business
declined over the last two years, have sustained heavy losses.
    ""Many companies, mainly export-oriented companies, were
planning on selling their shares for a profit to reinvest in
real businesses as the economy begins to pick up,"" said one
analyst at a foreign brokerage. ""That prospect now looks dim.""
    But analysts said it is unlikely companies or financial
institutions will be bankrupted by losses in stock trading.
    ""I don't think any company is so badly exposed in stock
investments,"" said a senior analyst at Nomura Research
Institute. ""In terms of financial institutions, luckily the
rebounding bond market and currency markets are still
profitable,"" he added.
    The Nomura analyst said a 10 pct decline in Tokyo stocks
would be translated into a fall of about 0.2 pct in consumer
spending. Some 20 pct of Tokyo stocks are owned by individuals.
    Market capitalisation on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to
329,588 billion yen on Tuesday from 386,041 billion at Monday's
close.
    NTT shares ended 260,000 yen lower at 2.65 mln each, well
down from their peak of 3.18 mln in April.

<TITLE>FORD &lt;F> REPEATS AUTO, TRUCK SALES FORECASTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ford Motor Co Chairman Donald Petersen
still expects slightly more than 15 mln U.S.-made cars and
trucks will be sold domestically in 1987, he told reporters.
    This is down from the 16.1 mln U.S. built vehicles sold
domestically last year, he added.
    Despite the sell-off in world stock markets, Petersen said,
the underlying fundamentals in the private sector of the U.S.
economy remain strong so calendar 1988 vehicle sales should
equal the 1987 total.
   
    Petersen said he could not explain nor predict stock market
activity.
    But he called for government officials to seriously address
long-term problems such as the trade and budget deficits,
stating the dollar is still too strong relative to other major
currencies.
    For example, he said, the dollar should be about 120 yen
currently instead of its present level just below 144 yen.
   
    Petersen said Ford plans to spend substantially more in the
next five years than the 15.9 billion dlrs spent in the last
five on new products and upgrading of its manufacturing
operations.
    In 1986, Ford spent 3.4 billion dlrs to upgrade vehicle
manufacturing plants, he noted.
    He also said growth in free world car and truck sales will
be 1.8 pct per year over the next 10 years.
    Worldwide over-capacity, which was about 2.7 mln units in
1985, could expand to nine mln units by 1990, with more than
five mln of those units in North America, Petersen said.

non-exclusive license to Resorts to use the Trump name and

operations and marketing of Resorts properties.
    The terms of the agreement call for Trump Hotel to receive

dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.
    However, DeCrane refused to say whether the two companies
were holding any settlement negotiations.
    ""Certainly the market shakeout might affect the way this is

    ""In this environment, cash looks very important.""
    DeCrane declined to say whether Texaco and Pennzoil had
held any recent settlement talks, citing a confidentiality
agreement between the two companies.
    ""A few months ago Texaco offered 100 mln dlrs cash, no
strings attached just to take this appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court,"" DeCrane said. He was referring to a non-settlement
proposal that would have eliminated the threat of Pennzoil
filing liens, or ownership rights, against Texaco property
before the company filed for bankruptcy protection in April.
    ""I think that (the offer) looks pretty good now to a
Pennzoil shareholder whose stock is trading around 30 or 40.""
    Settlement talks between the two companies reportedly broke
down earlier this year after Pennzoil insisted it would not
settle for less than four billion dlrs.
    Since then, Texaco has asked the Texas State Supreme Court
to review the 10.3 billion dlr judgment against it.
    DeCrane also said it was not clear if the stock market drop
could spur further consolidation in the oil patch.

<TITLE>U.S. SAFETY NETS SHOULD BLOCK 1929-TYPE CRASH</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Michael Posner</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cascading global stock prices are
evoking grim memories of the great market crash of 1929, but
analysts are reminding investors of safeguards in place before
they stash their savings under the mattress.
    But some also say that while banking, securities and social
laws written during the great depression should prevent a
repeat of that dismal era, more protection still might have to
be considered.
   
    And analysts caution that while new laws can deal with some
problems, lawmakers can't legislate away fear--which  helped
drive the New York Stock Exchange to its record 508-point Dow
Jones index loss on Monday.
    That 22.6 percent loss nearly doubled the Oct 29, 1929 
loss of 11.7 percent. On the day before that year, the market
fell nearly 13 per cent.
    In a series of Reuters interviews with government,
congressional and private analysts, most agreed safeguards
exist to avoid a repeat of 1929 and its depression aftermath.
    Charles Schultze, chairman of the president's Council of
Economic Advisers under Jimmy Carter, said in an interview that
""the safeguards should be adequate to avoid a repeat of 1929 to
1933.""
    ""The safeguards are fine,"" he said, ""The safeguards are
adequate to prevent a cascading liquidity failure. That's not
the overall problem which is the dollar and trade deficits.""
    Schultze, now with the Brookings Institution think-tank,
pointed to a weak Federal Reserve during the 1920s when ""the Fed
acted in the wrong way in 1929--it tightened money.""
   
    Similarly, President Reagan's budget manager, James Miller,
told Reuters the safeguards in place should be adequate.
    And millionaire oilman and business takeover specialist T.
Boone Pickens said the present safeguards should avoid any 1929
situation.
    ""It is a much more sophisticated system, I don't see that a
comparison is valid.""
    Marvin Kosters, director of economic policy studies at the
conservative American Enterprise Institute, thinks the present
safeguards will work.
   
    ""The main thing is the understanding of the Federal Reserve
of its responsibility to maintain liquidity in the economy,"" he
said. ""There is no reason why this (market fall) needs to spread
into the real economy. Maybe it's better it happened at all.""
    Rex Hardesty of the huge labor confederation AFL-CIO said
many of the present safeguards are not working, saying ""only
one-third of the unemployed are now receiving benefits.""
    He also called for an increase in the 3.35 dlr minimum wage
which has not been raised since 1981.
    One of the main things that appears different in 1987 than
in 1929 is market psychology, analysts point out.
    During those anything goes days of flappers and bathtub
gin, the stock market was the road to riches that captured the
savings of shoeshine boys to bank presidents. It was viewed as
a highway to heaven with no turning back.
    But happy days soon collapsed into a nationwide, hysterical
panic with the stock market crash, wiping out paper millions
and losing the life savings of many average investors as panic
set in.
    Brokers leaped from Wall Street skyscrapers. American banks
closed for a  ""holiday"" in 1933 as depositors clamored to pull
out their savings. The great depression followed leading into
World War II.
    Images of those days surfaced with the unprecedented sell
off on Monday, but analysts maintained times are different.
    House Banking committee specialist Jake Lewis said that
bank investors should have no fears because their savings are
now completely backed by the government. 
    Even though there have been record bank failures --145 last
year, 148 this year through today--everyone received their
savings--unlike the millions lost when banks collapsed 60 years
ago.
     Banking deposits, then uninsured, now are fully insured by
the government up to 100,000 dlrs for each saver.
    As the depression swept the nation, President Franklin
Roosevelt steered into law sweeping banking and securities
reforms to deal with many of the problems that led to the crash
and hurt people afterwards.

of tuberculosis and brucellosis from its cattle population, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    It said a state is recognized as tuberculosis-free if no
case of the disease is diagnosed for at least five years and if
the state complies with the uniform methods and rules of the
state-federal cooperative eradication program.
    To achieve brucellosis-free status, a state's cattle
population must remain uninfected for the previous 12 months.
    There are 33 states, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands,
classified as free of bovine tuberculosis and 24 states, plus
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which have eradicated
brucellosis. Only 20 states and the U.S. Virgin islands have

involving U.S. forces in the Gulf, the U.S. Senate voted to end
Republican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that
could give Congress a larger role in Gulf policy.
    The measure, however, does not require President Reagan to
comply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senate
bill. The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout
of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
    The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit
debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan
to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls
for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the
situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.
    The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue,
including an expression of support or of disapproval for
Reagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in
the waterway. The Pentagon said the 12th U.S.-protected convoy
began moving through the Gulf early Tuesday.

was surprised by recent criticism of West German economic
policies voiced by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker but
added that the criticism was not purely one-sided.
    Stoltenberg told the West German Trade and Industry
Association (DIHT) that before a meeting with Baker on Monday,
""There had been surprising notes of criticism (from the United
States)."" He added. ""Criticism is not a one-way street.""
    He did not elaborate, but Bonn has often called on the U.S.
To reduce its federal budget deficit.
    Over the weekend Baker had criticised West German economic
policies, saying that rises in domestic interest rates here
were not in the spirit of last February's Louvre pact to
stabilise currencies.
    Stoltenberg told the DIHT that his meeting on Monday with
Baker had resolved differences between the two countries.
    At a news conference earlier on Tuesday Stoltenberg had
declined to comment specifically on Baker's criticisms, but he
had said that after three hours of discussions on Monday, ""one

<TITLE>US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. military planners ruled out
Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack
mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the
Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.
    U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and
raided another in what the administration called a ""measured and
appropriate response"" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last
Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.
    Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig
rather than an onshore economic or military target such as
Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to
limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at
home and in the Gulf.
    ""It simply demonstrated the United States will take military
action when they (Iran) take military action,"" Norman Polmar, a
defense analyst and author, said.
    He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the
embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding
an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.
    In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the
potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that
could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.
    Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq
war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target
to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a
Security Council call for a ceasefire.
    ""We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any
chance at all,"" he said, adding that the action made it clear
tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.

   In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon
to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington
also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's
economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had
been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the
lower Gulf.
    ""We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown
Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting
capabilities,"" Cordesman said.
    He predicted the United States would respond to any future
major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar
Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the
approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.
    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the
United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, ""but
we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action
by Iran with stronger countermeasures.""

<TITLE>SPAIN APPEALS FOR EC HELP ON MAIZE IMPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spanish farm minister Carlos Romero,
speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers, called for action
to help the Spanish maize market, Spanish diplomatic sources
said.
    Spain is threatened with massive imports from third
countries by the end of the year, they said.
    They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the
accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will
import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum
into Spain from third countries this year.
    Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a
reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may
decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to
make direct purchases.
    The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries
should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the
Spanish market.
    They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC
Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached
would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help.
    The sources said no direct reply was given to Romero at the
meeting.

Powers said.

<TITLE>ASIAN COCOA PRODUCERS EXPAND DESPITE CRITICS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Clift</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Asian cocoa producers are expanding
output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss
suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior.
    ""Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market
from our product,"" said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate
general of plantations. ""We're happy about our long-term future.""
    Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in
Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable
for European tastes.
    They were responding to comments by London traders that
large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia
and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa
prices.
    London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered
unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a
high level of free fatty acids.
    Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers'
Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the
United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western
Europe.
    A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the
London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with
high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans.
    ""When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to
talk down prices,"" the spokesman said.
    He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.
    PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa
year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported
to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the
Netherlands and Britain.
    The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official
who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem
with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described
criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as ""trade politics""
and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it
did not have any difficulty with exports.
    Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodity
producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the
International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).
    Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to
total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.
    This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of
the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest
cocoa growing area.
    Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600
tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is
projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes
this year as young trees mature.
    Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and
traders said they could last out low prices longer than West
African countries.
    According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would
have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to
make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.
    Some traders believe the main quality problem is with
harvesting and fermentation techniques.
    One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually
indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the
same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian
estates.

<DATELINE>    QUITO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador posted a trade deficit of 71.3 mln
dlrs in the first eight months of 1987, compared with a surplus
of 468.6 mln dlrs in the same period of 1986, central bank
figures show.
    Ecuador suspended oil exports, which made up 55 pct of the
value of its total exports in 1986, for five months this year
after an earthquake in March shattered the country's pipeline.
    The central bank said the value of exports from January to
August 1987 stood at 1.132 billion dlrs and imports 1.204
billion dlrs. Net international monetary reserves declined to
57.5 mln dlrs at end-September from 146.8 mln dlrs at end-
September 1986.

shareholder rights plan which will allow shareholders to
purchase one common share for two dlrs if a hostile group
acquires 15 pct or more of the company.
    However, the company said the plan will not be triggered by
purchases pursuant to the 65 dlrs a share tender offer
commenced on October 9 by a unit of TLX Partners, a group
controlled by New York financier Asher Edelman.
    It said the rights will be distributed on a one for one
basis to all shareholders as of October 30 and may be redeemed
before they become exercisable at five cents per right.
    The company said the rights will expire on the later of
February 17 next year or 60 days from the date they become
exercisable. It said the plan was intended to protect
stockholders against any attempt to take unfair advantage of
the recent decline in stock prices or to use abusive tactics
such as market accumulations which would interfere with its
ability to maximize stockholder value.
    The rights become exercisable if any person or group
acquires 15 pct or more of the company's common stock other
than through an all cash tender offer for all outstanding
shares at 65 dlrs per share.
     It said the rights will also not become exercisable if the
company is acquired by a group under an agreement made with its

<DATELINE>    PARIS, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Airbus consortium is ready to
cooperate with U.S. Aerospace group McDonnell Douglas Corp on
future aircraft programs, pointing the way to a defusion of the
transatlantic dispute on subsidies to the aircraft industry,
French Transport Ministry Jacques Douffiagues said.
    He told the southern French daily Depeche du Midi in an
interview today that the talks between senior U.S. And European
Community officials in London on October 27 on the Airbus
question should be more harmonious as a result.
  
    Airbus officials said last week that they were continuing
talks on possible collaboration with McDonnell Doughlas on
aircraft projects, including an eventual stretched version of
the Airbus A320 short-haul jet, but that collaboration in the
immediate future was unlikely.
    U.S. Manufacturers and officials have charged that the
French, British and West German governments have disrupted the
world aviation market by unfairly subsidising Airbus, allowing
it to undercut private U.S. Competitors, while the Europeans
have responded by saying that U.S. Manufacturers benefit from
large government-funded military contracts.

<TITLE>AMERICAN EXPRESS SAYS ITS STRATEGY IS STABLE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alison Rea</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Express Co's &lt;AXP> president
Louis Gerstner Jr. said a bear market will not effect his
company's long-term strategy.
    ""I don't think where the market goes over any month long
period, two day period, or even six month period has anything
to do with our strategy,"" Gerstner told Reuters.
    ""We have built a strategy for our company that looks out
over many years and anticipates a lot of change,"" he said.
    Gerstner said the company's long term strategy is to build
and maintain a major position in the financial and travel
service industries. American Express is the 69 pct parent of
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc &lt;SHE>.
    Gerstner would not comment on the share market tailspin.
    However, American Express chairman James Robinson said in a
statement that the company could endure the market turbulence
and was in a strong position for further growth.
    ""All brokerage firms make money if the market goes down or
up,"" Gerstner told Reuters without elaborating.
    Gerstner said Shearson had no plans to quit its municipal
bond activities. ""Shearson Lehman Brothers tends to adjust to
trends in incremental steps. You will see it doing less of the
convulsive one-time changes that people in this industry will
go through,"" he said. Shearson recently laid off 150 people in
London and is limiting hiring, but Gerstner said American
Express remains committed to the London market and to having a
global presence.
    ""That Shearson let a couple of hundred people go in London
is not even an anthill on the landscape we're discussing. We
are discussing long-term strategy,"" Gerstner said.
    Earlier this year, American Express sold 13 pct of its
stake in Shearson to Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan and a
further 18 pct to the public. Gerstner said these moves ""had no
implications of an exit from financial services.""
    ""Our committment globally is represented by the Nippon
tie-up which dwarfs the fact we decided to reduce the size of
one department, in one company, in one of our subsidiaries,"" he
said.
    Many securities firms now are stressing merchant banking to
bolster earnings hurt by bond market volatility, slow retail
business and a drop in underwriting volume.
    When asked if more players would make the system more
risky, Gerstner said, ""I can't comment on other firms, but
Shearson is not going to follow a feeding frenzy in the
direction of merchant banking. We are not going to overreach.""
    Gerstner also spoke about securitization, or the
repackaging of debt as marketable securities.
    ""It is almost imperative to create a security backed by the
funds flowing from an LDC (lessor developed countries) debt
program. It is going to happen, but it is very difficult to
create a security in the current climate,"" Gerstner said.
    ""Securitized products could be structured for either the
retail or institutional markets,"" Gerstner said.
    ""If you look at the junk bond phenomenom, it started out
with mostly institutional buyers. Primarily through mutual
funds, individual buyers became a presense in the market. I'd
guess we'd see a similiar situation in LDC debt,"" he said.
    ""The fundamental thing that has to happen (before there can
be sucessful securitization) is that the debt burden on the
countries has to be reduced, and the amount of money coming
from the commerical banks and the future call for money on
commercial banks has to be reduced,"" Gerstner said.

award from Martin Marietta Corp &lt;ML> to make upgraded solid
rocket motors for the Titan Four launch vehicle will help

    ""We expect and we are fully confident that by 1992 we will

program is a substantial part of that,"" Hercules Aerospace head

    Hercules Inc, which also produces specialty chemicals and

<TITLE>BANK OF NEW YORK REAFFIRMS TERMS FOR IRVING &lt;V></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of New York Corp &lt;BK> said it
reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite
the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, a
Bank of New York spokesman said.
    ""The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer,"" a
Bank of New York spokesman said.
    Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market
affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back
any of its own shares.
    Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate
and said it wanted to retain its independence.
    In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per
share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6
pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one
Irving share.
    At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to
80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per
share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.
    According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender
for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.
    Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would
affect the acquisition.
    ""If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve
it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,""
said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.
    ""And the market is saying the deal won't go through,""
Alpert said.
    ""The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at
present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a
share, then they won't go at a lower price,"" another analyst
said.
    The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford
to retain its original offer.
    However, industry sources were more uncertain about
prospects for the deal.
    ""With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will
look good to Irving shareholders,"" said Michael Flores, a
consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.
    The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is
about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases
the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.
    Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely
to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking
industry.
    ""Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use
their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price
is too depressed,"" Alpert said.
    Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other
possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.
    ""In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered
more than the acquirees,"" another analyst said.

companies from repurchasing their own stock in the last half

repurchases until the close of market.

    Analysts said that widespread stock repurchases by many
firms today were a contributing factor in the market's rebound
from yesterday's huge losses.
    The rule prohibiting repurchases in the final half-hour of
trading works to prevent rapid end-of-day stock price rises

refrain from using its order-delivery systems for program

    He said the firms are free to use other systems to do
arbitrage between stock-index futures and their underlying

time to come,"" Phelan told a news conference.
    He said program trading adds liquidity to the market but
""at the extreme that adds to the volatility."" He said further
analysis of the issue is needed.
    Phelan said a significant number of corporations had begun
buying back their own stock in a move that helped blue chips
gain back some of Monday's losses.
    Asked how the record decline on Monday and the
unprecedented trading volume affected the financial health of

<TITLE>EC FARM MINISTERS BACK SPENDING CURBS IDEA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community (EC) agriculture
ministers gave their support in principle for a new scheme to
limit spending on the bloc's controversial farm policy at a
meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday, Danish minister Laurits
Tornaes told journalists.
    Acceptance of the scheme, by which farmers would suffer
price cuts if their production exceeded certain norms, known in
EC jargon as stabilisers, is seen by diplomats as vital if the
EC is to solve its current massive budget crisis.
    Speaking at a news conference after chairing a two-day
meeting of farm ministers, Tornaes said: ""It is no longer a
question of whether we are to have stabilisers. It is now a
question of how we are to implement them.""
    However, EC sources warned that despite Tornaes' optimism,
it may be difficult to get the sort of detailed agreement
needed on the stabiliser scheme ahead of an EC heads of
government meeting in Copenhagen on December 6.
    This is the vital meeting at which EC leaders will be asked
to agree a new system of EC financing, ending the bloc's
hand-to-mouth existence which has resulted in its being unable
to agree a budget for 1988.
    Britain has said it will block moves to give the EC
additional sources of finance unless a detailed system of
stabilisers is agreed at or ahead of the summit.
    Under the most important stabiliser scheme, EC guaranteed
prices for cereals would be cut by one percentage point for
every per cent by which the annual harvest exceeded 155 mln
tonnes, a figure well below what EC farmers are capable of
producing in a year of favourable weather conditions.
   Farm ministers will meet again on November 16 to attempt to
hammer out an accord, and Danish diplomatic sources said the
meeting could last through several long nights of negotiation.
    But Tornaes said any thought that success was not
ultimately possible would be a gesture of retreat at this
stage.
    EC Commission sources said among the remaining problems
were appeals from Southern member states for protection for
their small and relatively poor farmers, and calls from France
and the Netherlands for significant changes to Commission
proposals for arable crops.
    They added that West Germany appears still reluctant to
accept the idea of production ceilings being set at the level
of the EC as a whole rather than that of member states.
    Meanwhile, the ministers made little progress in agreeing a
scheme to top up the income of poorer farmers through direct
payments, which could help to cushion the impact of stabilisers
on them.
    British minister John MacGregor told journalists :""The
proposals as they stand have very few friends.""
    He said a number of countries fear they could simply
encourage further unwanted production by giving farmers the
cash to improve production methods.

<TITLE>INDONESIA FINDS NEW OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS RESOURCES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Indonesian state-owned oil company
Pertamina has found new offshore oil and gas resources in East
Aceh, on the western tip of northern Sumatra, a company
spokesman said.
    The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1
offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh.
    ""Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300
metres within the Baong formation,"" he said.
    He said preliminary tests showed that the well could flow
oil at the rate of 1,320 barrels a day with 50 degrees API at
20 degrees centigrade through a 5/8 inch choke.
    ""The well also flows natural gas at the rate of 12 mln
standard cubic feet a day,"" he added.
    GOS IA-1 well, located at a water depth of 41 metres, was
drilled under a production sharing contract between Pertamina
and Japex North Sumatra Ltd, each having 50 pct shares.
    ""Petroleum operations are to be carried out by Pertamina as
operator through a joint operating body established by the two
companies,"" the Pertamina spokesman stated.
    The contract covers the Gebang block contract area. The two
companies have previously completed the drilling of GOS IIA-1
exploratory well, around 14 kms south of GOS IA-1.

<TITLE>BRAZIL'S SEPT TRADE SURPLUS HIGHEST OF THE YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's September trade surplus
was the best so far this year, totalling 1.494 billion dlrs,
compared with 1.434 billion dlrs in August and 540 mln dlrs in
September last year, Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department
(Cacex) director Namir Salek said in a news conference.
    September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down
from 2.76 billion dlrs in August. Imports in September amounted
to 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in August.
    Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period
was 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in a
similar 1986 period.
    Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222
mln dlrs in August and 212 mln in September 1986, Salek said.
    The Cacex director said he expected the country's trade
surplus to average 800 mln dlrs in the remaining three months
of the year, estimating the year's overall surplus to reach
10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and
15.4 billion dlrs of imports.
    He attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured
and semimanufactured goods. He mentioned car exports, which
accounted alone with sales of 617 mln dlrs in the Jan-Sept
period, against 194 mln dlrs in a similar 1986 period.

<TITLE>TREASURY'S BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>As official Washington sought to
restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street
collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from
critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.
    Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for
boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an
international accord to stabilize currency values.
    Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was
among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped
spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors
think that a clash between the two major economic powers would
damage the world economy.
    Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, ""I
think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I
think, was partly due to statements that have been made by
senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic."" It was a
dispute that should never have happened, he added.
    Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a
hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  
still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United
States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to
Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.
    Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, ""His
timing could not have been worse.""
    One government bond salesman in New York said, ""He actually
thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack
the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much
understanding of international monetary gamesmanship.""
    However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march
toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.
    ""On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if
you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial
markets), it was West German policy,"" said Robert Brusca of
Nikko Securities International in New York.
    ""All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so
making him responsible for it was a little like killing the
messenger,"" he said.
    After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments
made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together
in Paris in February, was still in effect.
    Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be
a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to
the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash
wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.
   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about
Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the
global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest
rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.
    He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th
month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic
expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge
market for debtor country exports.
    Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried
that the Republican party might face next year's presidential
election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly
tarnished.
    A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt
crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has
already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.
    ""There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the
economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around
quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and
eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,""
former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a
television interview.
    In many ways, the official response was mild.
    Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,
with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting
that he was ""puzzled.""
    U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately
returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments
and, presumably, their political impact.
    For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in
Washington will diminish because of the market fall.
    Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because
of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd
Bentsen said with some irony, ""Oh, I think it's much too late to
be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the
attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---
retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do
that.""

<TITLE>U.S. STOCK DROP SEEN SLOWING JAPANESE BUYING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Hisanobu Ohse</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>A collapse in U.S. stock prices has  hit
Japanese investors hard, since they had shifted to stocks from
bonds earlier this year, and will slow down Japanese capital
flows to the U.S., investors and stock brokers said.
   Until recently Japanese net purchases of U.S. stocks were
projected to leap to eight to 12 billion dlrs this year from
four billion dlrs in 1986, securities industry sources said.
   ""The Japanese had suffered severely from U.S. bond
investments and now (they are suffering) in U.S. stocks,"" said
Hiroyuki Kondo of Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd.
    Japanese portfolio investment was concentrated in Treasury
securities until early this year, which led to heavy currency
losses following the dollar's steep decline. Even though their
U.S. bond purchases moderated since then, Japanese investors
continued to suffer losses as bond prices fell sharply in
recent months.
    Now the historic fall in the U.S. stock market has stunned
Japanese investors, killing their appetite for U.S. stocks.
    Keita Konishi of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co said while his
firm was not panicked into an across-the-board sell-off of its
U.S. stock investments, he does not expect it to resume buying
stocks for some time.
    There has been no panic selling by Japanese institutional
investors so far during the stock price nosedive, said Susumu
Uchiyama of Yamaichi Internatinal (America), Inc. Following the
steep decline, however, Japanese are not buying, even though
U.S. stocks now appear bargain-priced, he said.
    ""There will be no big wave of Japanese investment in the
U.S. for the time being,"" said Keiji Tsuda of Nissei BOT Asset
Management Corp, an investment advisory body to Nippon Life
Insurance Co.
    ""It's the time to think twice. The psychological impact (on
investors' behaviour) will drag on considerably,"" he said.
    The latest turmoil in the financial market was triggered by
U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker as he threatened a futher
dollar fall in retaliation for higher West German interest rate
rises, and undermined foreign investors' confidence in the
dollar, Tsuda said.
    The U.S. economy is still sitting on the time bomb of huge
budget and trade deficits, he said, and investors' worries over
the twin problems have intensified.
    ""Before I thought the dollar's large fall (over the past
two years) would take out the detonator out of that bomb, but
it hasn't,"" Tsuda said.
    Investors and brokers said the Japanese for the first time
have experienced the enormous volatality of the New York stock
market, often caused by ""program trading.""
    A stock trader at Daiwa Securities America Inc said that
while Japanese investors had been attracted by American firms'
superior performance relative to Japanese firms in terms of
earnings per share, U.S. stocks' downside potential is now much
larger than that oJapanese stocks.
    While the Japanese stock market has also taken a nosedive,
it could be stabilized by the efforts of large Japanse firms.
    A high percentage of Japanese equities are held by
companies who will hold on to their stocks and the stocks of
other Japanese firms in order to strengthen their business ties
through this cross-holding relationship, analysts said.
    Despite the massacare on the Wall Street, Japanese
investors are not expected to withdraw from U.S. stocks.
    U.S. equities are in a process to be built in
diversification of their portfolios and the portion of them is
still very small, Japanese investors said. But, it is unclear
when the Japanese will resume purchasing U.S. stocks and much
depends on the dollar's stability, they said.
    Kondo of Yasuda Trust said Japanese investors are not fully
convinced that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is
determined to fend the dollar's value and check future
inflation in the U.S.
    Because of uncertainty over the dollar's direction and
inflation in the U.S., Japanese investors have not yet jumped
on the Treasury bonds despite the latest sharp bond yield
rises, investors said.
    Konishi of Sumitomo Life said ""A U.S. recession is being
talked about, so it may be time to shift back to bonds, but I
feel uneasy about buying any U.S. instruments right now.""
    Tsuda of Nissei questioned the strength of the recent rally
in U.S. government bond prices. He said the steep bond market
rally has no real trend as bond prices are rising on short
covering and bills are rising on temporary fund shift from the
stock market.

entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a
selective basis.""
    Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil
reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
industry sources say.
    Subroto said the government was also working to ease other
problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
deep water conditions.
    But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
that the oil price had recovered.
    President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
industry for the regions in which companies operated.
    Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company
Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to
fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
1986.
    Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
contracts with foreign oil companies.
    Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
operations was a government priority. There had been
misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
    He said the government wanted to finalise contract
extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
    Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain
exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
within 10 years. ""This need in itself is some sort of guarantee
that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.""
    Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
    Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
    Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
would be selective, based on how much capital would be
invested.

<TITLE>REAGAN SAYS HE IS WILLING TO NEGOTIATE ON BUDGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said he had ordered
the administration to begin talks with congressional leaders on
a budget deficit reduction plan.
    Reagan said in a statement following a meeting with his top
economic advisers that he was prepared to order across the
board spending cuts to comply with a Federal balanced budget
law, but preferred to negotiate with Congress.
    He said he would consider anything the congressional
leadership proposed, but a spokesman said he remains opposed to
raising taxes as a way to reduce the deficit.
    ""I think it is preferable, if possible that the executive
and legislative branches reach a budget deficit reduction
package. Accordingly, I am directing that discussions be
undertaken with the bipartisan leadership of the Congress for
that purpose,"" Reagan said.
    Asked whether he would consider raising taxes, Reagan said
""I am willing to look at whatever proposal they might have.""
    As Reagan boarded the helicopter to visit his wife Nancy at
Bethesda Naval Hospital, he was questioned as to whether that
meant he was softening on his tax stance. Reagan replied ""if you
heard that it must have been the helicopter.""
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater later told reporters
that Reagan was not changing his opposition to tax increases.
Fitzwater said the administration would accept automatic cuts
under the Gramm Rudman balanced budget law rather than raise
taxes.
    Earlier on Tuesday congressional leaders called for an
economic summit with the White House to address the nation's
budget and trade deficits that some analysts say were partly to
blame for the stock market drop.
    Reagan said he would be willing to participate personally
in any negotiations with Congress.
    The White House earlier seemed to reject the idea of
negotiating with Congress on the budget deficit.
    Fitzwater said this morning that the White House continued
to oppose a budget summit with Congress on the grounds that it
would be used by Democrats as a platform to press for a tax
increase.
    But Reagan announced his willingness to negotiate with
Congress after meeting for about an hour with White House Chief
of Staff Howard Baker, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and chief economic
adviser Beryl Sprinkel.

<TITLE>PACIFIC EXCHANGE MAY SEE RECORD VOLUME AGAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pacific Stock Exchange Chairman
Maurice Mann said the exchange may have reached record volume
again today, following yesterday's record 17.6 mln shares.
    it looks like at least the same volume as yesterday, Mann
said at a news conference following the close.
    The exchange closed one-half hour early for the second
straight day. Mann said the exchange will determine daily
whether or not to close early over the next several days.
    Mann said the only major operational problem today occurred
when the exchange had to stop trading 30 over-the-counter
options, 17 of which trading were restored later in the day.
    He said the options had to be halted because price
information on the underlying stocks was not being disseminated
on the floor quickly enough.
    ""You cannot trade an option, unless you know how much its
worth,"" he said.
    Mann said the exchange's computer system was working better
than had been expected under the pressure of the heavy trading
volume.
    ""This system was not designed to do what it did today and
yesterday,"" he said.
    He said technical adjustments to the system since yesterday
improved today's operations. He would not elaborate.
    Mann said the decision to close the exchange early was not
due to concerns over the vulnerability of being open one half
hour after New York closed. Rather, he said, it was to allow
trades to be tallied in conformance with other exchanges.
    In Los Angeles, traders said although trading was hectic,
they were able to keep up with orders better than yesterday.
    ""We could handle the orders we got. Things seem to be
smoothing out,"" said Richard Goforth, a partner with Crowell
Weedon and Co who trades on the Los Angeles exchange floor.
    Goforth, added, however, traders expected to be there into
the evening sorting out the paperwork on their trades.
    Jefferies and Co Director of Trading James Melton said the
firm has been extremely busy making markets in halted stocks
and in after hours trading. He said Jefferies has been trading
about 15 hours a day, beginning at 0300 pdt.
    Melton said Jefferies made markets in such blue chip stocks
as International Business Machines &lt;IBM>, Allegis Corp &lt;AEG>
and Merck and Co &lt;MRK> while they were halted on the exchanges.
    Melton declined to give volumes of off-market trading the
company has been doing, but said, ""its just very, very busy...
when the stocks are halted our markets are very active."" He
said he expects the heavy volume to continue through the week.
    While sellers still predominated, Melton added, ""people
were bottom fishing a little bit in the blue chips...but its
very nervous.""

<TITLE>FIRST REPUBLICBANK &lt;FRB> TROUBLED LOANS RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>First RepublicBank Corp, the largest bank
holding company in Texas, reported a loss of 6.3 mln dlrs for
the third quarter and said that its non-performing loans rose
sharply because of a further deterioration in Texas's real
estate market.
    There was no comparable figure for the third quarter of
1986 because the company was formed in June 1987 through the
merger of RepublicBank Corp and Interfirst Corp.
    Non-performing loans were 3.1 billion dlrs at the end of
September, or 12.4 pct of total assets, mpared with 9.5 pct
at the end of the second quarter.
    Loans secured by real estate accounted for about 90 pct of
the 706 mln dlr increase in non-performing loans in the third
quarter, First Republicbank said.
    It said the poor shape of the office and retail housing
markets in Dallas, Houston and Austin will continue to hold
back earnings.
    ""As indicated earlier in 1987 by First RepublicBank, the
company will continue to assess future common stock dividend
payments relative to earnings performance,"" Gerald
Fronterhouse, chairman and chief executive officier, said in a
statement.
    First RepublicBank said its third-quarter loan loss
provision of 106 mln dlrs and net charge-offs of 87 mln dlrs
left its total allowance for credit losses at 1.14 billion
dlrs, or 4.6 pct of the loan portfolio.
    The company's primary capital amounted to 7.9 pct of assets
at the end of September.
    The 6.3 mln dlr loss was sustained despite a 29 mln dlr cut
in overhead, achieved partly by staff attrition. The size of
the combined staffs of the two banks has been cut by 12 pct so
far this year, and Fronterhouse said the bank is ahead of the
schedule it set for achieving savings through the merger.

<TITLE>U.S. MAY END ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States may lift an
additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later
this month, Reagan Administration officials said.
    President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on
Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986
agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third
country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.
    The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on
Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and
portable computers.
    Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after
Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at
below production costs.
    Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory
and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.
    The Administration officials said Commerce Department 
monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the
semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking
sales away from American-made semiconductors.
    They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would
be lifted by the end of the month.
    The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the
closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.
    U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance
with the agreement earlier this week.
    The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining
sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is
in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.

<TITLE>STOCK CLOSURE MAY HARM H.K. REPUTATION - OFFICIALS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Stockbrokers and legislators welcomed
the suspension of trading on the local market after Monday's
record fall, but some said the suspension was too long and
could harm the territory's reputation as a financial centre.
    Announcing the suspension until next Monday, stock exchange
chairman Ronald Li said earlier today ""This will protect
investors and allow brokers to settle a backlog of orders.""
    But legislator David Li, who is also managing director of
the Bank of East Asia, while weloming the move, said a one-day
halt would have been enough.
    ""I believe the exchange is over-reacting. A long suspension
will damage Hong Kong's reputation as a financial centre and
hurt foreign investors' confidence,"" David Li said.
    Legislator Hui Yin-fat echoed this view. ""What will they do
if the market resumes its fall next week ?"" he asked.
    Legislator Lee Yu-tai said small investors would be
hard-hit by the decision. He said some were paying interest on
loans to purchase stock and a long suspension increased their
losses.
    Financial Secretary Piers Jacobs said the decision was
explainable, but he added, ""It does seem rather a long time.""
    However, George Tan, assistant director of Greenwell
Montagu (Far East) Ltd, said the suspension was wise. ""Hong Kong
is a volatile market and this will let things settle down,"" he
said.
    Other brokers agreed. ""At least this gives us a bit of
breathing space,"" said one.
    John MacKenzie, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of
Banks, said ""I feel that it is not at all a bad thing that
investors and investment mnanagers be given a breathing space.""
    Hong Kong's main share indicator, the Hang Seng index, fell
420.81 points to 3,362.39 on Monday - its biggest ever one-day
fall in real terms.

<TITLE>CANADIAN PACIFIC (CP) UNIT STUDIES PULP MILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     MONTREAL, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>CIP Inc, wholly-owned by Canadian
Pacific Ltd, is considering building a pulp mill in Texas which
would use kenaf fibre instead of wood, CIP president Cecil
Slenniken said in an interview.
     The kenaf plant is a member of the hibiscus family and was
artificially developed several years ago. The plant, which has
been grown in Southern Texas, reaches a height of 10 feet in
three months and is said to produce better quality newsprint
than wood pulp, a CIP official said.
     Slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a
200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre but
would need partners to begin the project.
    ""We are not yet ready to commit the hundreds of millions of
dollars it would take for such a project,"" Slenniken said.
     He said CIP has been using the pulp on a trial basis to
make newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pct
softwood fibre at its Trois-Rivieres, Quebec plant.
    CIP, Canada's second largest newsprint producer, recently
launched a 366 mln Canadian dlr newsprint mill at Gold River,
British Columbia which is due begin producing 230,000 metric
tonnes per year by fall of 1989.

<DATELINE>    NICOSIA, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for
compensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf
oil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.
    The lawsuits would be filed with competent international
bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted
telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the
damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.
    The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American
destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after
the attack, he said.
    Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was
preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to
a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle
City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
    He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs
""except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence."" Reacting to
Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed,
Aqazadeh said: ""Iran will also consider the case closed after
its retaliatory measure."" Iranian officials have said their
response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests
around the world might come under attack.
    Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf
aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's
oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack
significantly affecting oil prices.
    IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the
attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the
entrance to the Gulf.
    ""If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait, no other country can
either, and this would be to everyone's harm,"" the radio quoted
him as saying.

<TITLE>FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY BLASTS REAGAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former Treasury Secretary William Simon
sharply criticised President Reagan for irresponsible fiscal
policies that contributed to this week's stock price collapse.
    ""(Reagan) fell for that siren song that you can cut taxes
without cutting spending and that we would 'grow our way out of
this,' and everything would be wonderful,"" Simon said, in an
apparent reference to the massive U.S. budget deficit.
    ""Every time we hear that nonsense we ought to howl with
pain as we were howling yesterday and are howling today,"" he
said in an interview taped this afternoon for the MacNeil
Lehrer Newshour which will air at 1930 EDT (2330 GMT).
    Simon, who held his post under presidents Nixon and Ford,
said Reagan's tax cuts are positive for saving and investment.
    And he blamed Congress for causing the U.S.'s fiscal
problems by putting self-interest ahead of national interest.
    ""It's not only the president. It's Congress ... under
Republicans and Democrats alike,"" he said. ""They're a bunch of
hypocrites who have one credo -- that credo is 'more.'""

<DATELINE>    JACKSON, Miss., Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>First Mississippi Corp said in
view of the recent decline in its stock price due to the drop

    ""The Commission remains in frequent contact with the
futures markets which trade stock index futures and options,
each of which has confirmed the collection of clearing margins
called for as a consequence of futures trading on Monday,
October 19, 1987,"" the CFTC said in a statement.
    Four U.S. exchanges briefly halted stock index futures
trading Tuesday, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) urged
members to refrain from using program trading.
    Acting CFTC Chairman Kalo Hineman said CFTC continued to
""closely monitor the financial integrity of firms with
positions in the stock index futures and options markets.""
    A futures industry official said there was some concern
among industry leaders that stock index futures would be blamed
for the stock market's nosedive on Monday.
    ""This is an equity market problem,"" the official said. ""Our

    Some lawmakers focused criticism on index arbitrage

<TITLE>COMPUTER SYSTEMS STRAINED BY MARKET COLLAPSE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lawrence Edelman</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The nation's exchanges and brokerage
houses said their computers systems have been strained by the
avalanche of trading triggered by the past week's stock market
collapse.
    And while the financial instry's hi-tech resources have
been able to handle the crisis, the sudden surge in trading
volume will likely force the exchanges and securities firms to
revamp their computer systems and communications networks
several years earlier than they had planned, industry officials
said.
    ""We had already started certain processes to increase the
New York Stock Exchange's capacity,"" said Jim Squyres, a
spokesman for the Securities Industry Automation Corp, which
runs the central computer network for the New York and American
Stock Exchanges.
    ""We will have to seriously consider speeding that up,"" he
said. After three straight days of record volume, however, many
exchanges were pushing their systems to untested limits. And
while the exchanges said their computers were handling the
crush, brokers and traders complained about lost trades and
delayed price quotes.
    The most serious problems arose on Monday, when a record
fall of 508 points in the dow and volume of more than 600 mln
shares on the New york stock exchange stunned the entire
industry.
    The American Stock Exchange's order-routing system crashed
just 10 minutes before trading closed. The Pacific Stock
Exchange suspended business a half-hour early so it could catch
up with a massive backlog of trades.
    And the price-quote feed supplied by the NYSE was cut off
several times during the day, leaving some traders with quotes
that were often 45 minutes behind the actual market.
     Although the computers whirred away late into the night,
the exchanges opened on time Tuesday and problems were fewer,
even though NYSE volume swelled to 610 mln shares. Combined
volume of the NYSE, American and over-the-counter exchanges
topped 900 mln shares.
    ""I think we're equipped for this kind of trading,"" said
Paul Stevens, executive vice president of operations for the
American Stock Exchange.
    ""The problem is less the computers, which are handling the
volume, than the strain on people,"" he said.
   
     ""The computers might turn out to be the heroes of this
whole thing,"" added DuWayne Peterson, executive vice president
of technology at Merrill Lynch and Co Inc.
    In fact, officials said the biggest constraint on trading
was caused by some of the oldest machines on exchange floors,
the card printers that issue the buy and sell orders.
    But even as computer executives spoke with awe about their
systems' ability to hold up under unprecedented pressure, they
started to plan for the future.

     ""We had to do a lot of innovative things to handle this
volume,"" said Squyres of the Securities Industry Automation
Corp (SIAC), which is jointly owned by the New York and
American Stock exchanges.
    SIAC had planned to boost the capacity of its system by up
to 50 pct by 1990. But that and other improvements will now be
made much earlier.
    Meanwhile, New York Telephone Co said Monday's panic
selling did not wreak havoc on its telephone system.
    ""It was a normally heavy business day,"" said company
spokesman Steve Marcus.

President Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets
in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy
in the volatile region.
    Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed
Monday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in
retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship
flying the American flag.
    The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S.
resolve that Iran ""cannot take military action against the
United States with impunity.""
    Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and
set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role
in making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require
Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead
to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
    While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S.
retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing
U.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan
comply with the War Powers Act.

downgrade the 100 mln dlrs of B-plus 13-5/8 pct senior
subordinated debentures due 1997 of Bally Health and Tennis
Corp, a unit of Bally Manufacturing Corp.
    S and P cited the parent's proposals to sell Bally Health
for more than 500 mln dlrs to an investor group. It noted the
transaction includes the assumption of Bally Health's debt.
    Although the investor group's plans are not known, the
acquisition will probably be debt financed and markedly
increase Bally Health's financial risk. S and P said the sale
of the unit would increase the parent's financial position.
    In a related action, Standard and Poor's affirmed the debt
ratings of Bally Manufacturing and related entities. Affirmed
were BB first mortgage bonds, BB-minus second mortgage bonds
and B-plus subordinated debt.
    S and P said pro-form debt leverage for Bally
Manufacturing, adjusted to capitalize operating leases, drops
to a still high 68 pct from an aggressive 75.5 pct at June 30.
Adjusted for asset sales, the parent company's return on

    The central bank injected funds through three-month

    In the bond market, the Bank of Japan offered to buy around
50 billion yen of 10-year government bonds, encouraging an

<TITLE>STOCK MARKET'S FALL MAY BE BAD OMEN FOR REPUBLICANS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By MICHAEL GELB</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Monday's stock market collapse could
spell disaster for Republican hopes of retaining the White
House in 1988 -- if it proves to be the start of a general
economic downturn -- political experts said.
    ""The question is does the stock market (decline) signal an
impending recession. If that is the case the Republicans will
have a very difficult time winning,"" independent political
analyst William Schneider told Reuters. ""If the Democrats
nominate anyone halfway credible they would win,"" he added.
    Schneider's comments, on the heels of a 500-point decline
in the bellwheter Dow Jones stock market average, reflected the
old political adage that elections are almost always decided by
voters' feelings about their financial well being.
    ""There is no doubt people always vote their pocketbook and
we don't expect 1988 to be any different,"" says Donald Foley,
the top spokesman for Missouri Representative Richard
Gephardt's Democratic presidential campaign.
    Foley added that the five-year old stock market rally has
shown amazing resilience and ""there's no telling where the
market will be by the end of the week.""
    President Reagan said he was puzzled by the day's events,
but is convinced the economy is fundamentally sound.
    ""I think everyone is puzzled ... because all the business
indices are up. There is nothing wrong with the economy,"" he
told reporters.
    ""I don't think anyone should panic because all the economic
indicators are solid,"" he added.
    But for the time being, the decline on Wall Street knocked
the underpinnings from his boasts that the record bull market
demonstrates the wisdom of current economic policy.
    It could also deprive the Republicans of a major argument
for keeping the White House in their hands when President
Reagan leaves office in January 1989.
    It gives a hollow ring to the words used by Vice President
George Bush just a week ago when he formally entered the White
House race.
    ""We have weathered the storm. Our economy has recovered to
be the strongest in history,"" Bush said in reference to the
recovery from the 1981-82 recession that pushed unemployment to
its highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
    ""We mark next week the longest peacetime economic expansion
in our nation's recorded history,"" Bush bragged.
    At midday, even as Wall Street was being battered by a
record selling panic, Reagan gave a glowing account of the
economy's performance at a swearing in ceremony for his new
Commerce Secretary, William Verity.
    Indeed, the Labor Department reported earlier this month
that unemployment among American workers had fallen to an
eight-year low of 5.9 pct in September, compared to seven pct a
year ago and a Post World War Two peak of 10.7 pct in December
1982.
    But with interest rates climbing steadily and no
improvement in the record U.S. trade deficit with the rest of
the world, a number of economic experts have expressed doubts
about the staying power of the current expansion.
   Warnings of economic danger around the corner have been a
staple of Democratic campaign speeches this year.
    And Democratic party leaders here for an organizational
meeting two weeks ago predicted at that time that the economy
would be the determining factor in next year's election.
    ""The 1988 election will be decided, as most peacetime
elections are, on economic issues,"" said Michigan party chairman
Richard Weiner.
    ""In Ohio, people are uneasy. They want to know where the
economy is going,"" added Ohio Democratic leader James Ruvulo.
    American political history is replete with examples of
voters throwing out incumbent officeholders when the economy
turns sour -- most notably in 1932 when Democrat Franklin
Roosevelt won a landslide triumph that ended 12 years of
Republican rule and made the Democrats the nation's majority
party for more than 40 years.
    But political experts said that if Monday's stock decline
turns out to be a temporary phenomena it will have no effect on
the 1988 election.
    ""Times change, conditions change,"" Schneider said.
    Quoting legendary baseball manager Casey Stengel, Schneider
added, ""Never make predictions, especially about the future.""

<TITLE>TOKYO BROKERS SEE SHARP EARLY STOCK PRICE FALL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By James Kynge</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Stock market analysts polled before Tokyo's
market opened on Tuesday said Wall Street's dramatic fall on
Monday was overdone and although Tokyo would fall drastically
at the opening it might stabilise later.
    Factors affecting the Tokyo market are not the same as
those in New York, they said.
    ""Tokyo's market is completely different from New York,"" said
a senior analyst at Nomura Securities. ""We have no computer
(program) selling, and much more stable share ownership than in
New York.""
    ""The discount rate in Japan cannot rise,"" the senior Nomura
analyst said.
    He said the Tokyo Exchange's 225-share index may fall 1,000
points on Tuesday, because of basic concern. It dropped 620.18
points to 25,746.56 on Monday.
    But he said a 1,000 point fall would be nothing compared to
New York. ""New York overreacted, the dollar is rising -- that
should be a positive sign for New York,"" he said.
    The Tokyo Stock Exchange opens from 0900 local time (0000
GMT) to 1500 local (0600 GMT).
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 508 points (or 22.5
pct) to 1,738 on Monday, its biggest ever one day decline in
both absolute and percentage terms.
    Simon Smithson, a Kleinwort Benson International share
analyst, said Tokyo's market was likely to free fall in morning
trading but perhaps would stabilise later. He too predicted a
drop of perhaps 1,000 points in the index today.
    But he said overall economic conditions in the U.S. And
Japan were different. ""The problems that pushed down the New
York market, like the (U.S.) budget deficit, trade deficit and
slow economic growth, do not exist in Japan,"" Smithson said.
    However, a stocks fund manager at a major trust bank made a
more gloomy prediction. ""The situation is different in the two
markets, but you cannot ignore New York,"" he said.
    ""Foreigners will be selling and the index funds will be
selling,"" he said.
    A fund manager at another Japanese trust bank said Monday's
New York fall was completely out of the range of expectations.
    ""All we can do is wait now and see what happens. There seem
to be no factors which would stop the fall. There is no way we
can invest now,"" he said.

president Thomas Labrecque said the sharp decline in the stock
market was not justified by economic conditions and there was a
need for perspective by investors on fundamental economic
conditions.
    ""If we are right about the fundamentals, this thing should
settle down,"" Labrecque said at a news conference at the
American Bankers Associatioon annual convention here.
    Labrecque also said the stock market drop could cause U.S.
monetary officials to ease credit policies.
    Inflation fears are exaggerated and Chase still believes
inflation will not rise much beyond five percent this year,
Labrecque said.
   He said strong economic conditions would permit growth to
continue well into 1988.
    ""I don't think the stock market will cause a recession,""
Labrecque said.
    He said he could not estimate what the impact on Chase from
the stock market fall would be. Chase's stock price, however,
dropped 23 pct, but other money center banks suffered even
sharper losses.
    Referring to the banking industry, he said: ""We're talking
about one day.""
    ""These are strong institutions,"" he said. Labrecque said he
did not think the Federal Reserve Board would tighten monetary
policy in view of the stock market's behavior.
    ""If there is a bias I expect it would be a little bit the
other way,"" he said. Labrecque said the high U.S. budget deficit
was not the single most important factor behind the market's
worries.
    He called for closer cooperation in economic policy by the
United States, West Germany, Japan and Britain.

<TITLE>BRITAIN TAKES STRONG LINE ON EC FARM BUDGET PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>British foreign secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe told his EC colleagues on Monday that Britain wants
agreement by December on a detailed plan to curb EC farm
spending if it is to sanction an increase in EC budgetary
resources.
    British diplomatic sources quoted Howe as saying that an
accord containing detailed figures and involving immediate
penalties for farmers in the case of overproduction must be
reached in advance of an EC heads of government summit meeting
in December.
    ""We require numbers as well as words in all the commodity
regimes,"" Howe was quoted as saying.
    The EC Commission proposed last month a plan for ""budgetary
stabilisers"" under which there would be reductions in guaranteed
prices, restrictions of sales into intervention or increases in
coresponsibility levies if output of individual commodities
exceeded certain levels.
    Britain has so far given the clearest backing to the idea,
although several other EC states back it in outline.
    Diplomats say Britain can exercise some leverage on the
issue because the EC is in a severe budgetary crisis from which
it can only emerge if all 12 member states agree to revise the
system by which it is financed.
    The sources quoted Howe as saying: ""An interim or partial
solution covering some elements of the Commission package would
be unacceptable to the United Kingdom.""
    They said he insisted that any penalties imposed on farmers
for exceeding production limits must take effect in the same
marketing year as the overproduction, rather than resulting in
a price adjustment the following year.
    Howe also said there should be no question of a special
fund which could top up EC farm coffers in the event of an
unexpected development such as a major fall in the value of the
dollar.
    The Commission has suggested such a fund to deal with
emergency situations.
    French EC affairs minister Bernard Bosson told journalists
that his country could not accept the idea that there should be
no emergency reserve.
    ""The British position has become tougher,"" he said.
    Howe was speaking at a meeting of EC foreign ministers,
which discussed the future of EC finances, and which took place
simultaneously with a farm ministers' meeting to consider the
Commission's farm spending proposals.
    Before his meeting got under way, British agriculture
minister John MacGregor said he backed the Commission proposal
to set the 1988 cereals production ceiling at 155 mln tonnes.

<TITLE>US SAYS CANADIAN, ISRAELI PACTS SHOULD SPUR TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada
and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the
global trading system.
    He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back
worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.
    The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay
to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it
trade in agriculture and services such as banking.
    Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting
marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The
Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet
been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.
    The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove
tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and
many services.
    Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli
pacts ""other countries have realized that if they want to
continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had
better get serious about improving the GATT.""
    The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing
shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially
increase the gross national products in both countries.
    Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should
serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.
    Yeutter said, ""increasing trade is one of the keys to
enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.""
    He said, ""a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only
for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries
that need to increase trade in order to better their standards
of living.""
    Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress
made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to
protectionism.
    He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress
that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions
against nations with large trade surpluses with the United
States if the countries practiced unfair trade.
    The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade
deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still
rising.
    Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to
resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President
Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.
    Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.
    He said, ""President Reagan will veto any bill that contains
serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.""

<TITLE>EC STATES ATTACK PLAN TO PENALISE FARMERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>EC agriculture ministers attacked
plans to penalise farmers immediately it becomes clear that
cereals output is above standard norms, EC sources said.
    They said this was the major criticism raised at a meeting
of ministers which discussed Commission proposals for curbing
spending on the cereals regime.
    The Commission wants powers to cut guaranteed prices or
raise the coresponsibility levy if output next harvest rises
above 155 mln tonnes.
    The sources said several ministers complained that changing
price levels in the middle of a season would severely damage
the financial security of farmers.
    But an EC Commission spokesman said farm commissioner Frans
Andriessen told them producers could not be guaranteed security
regardless of market circumstances.
    The sources said there was a general acceptance of the need
for some output ceilings. However, the French and Dutch
ministers called for a maximum output for a wider range of
cereal crops, rather than for cereals alone.
    The sources added West Germany wanted production ceilings
for individual countries with excess production being paid for
from national exchequers, but received no support for this
idea.
    British farm minister John MacGregor told reporters he
detected more support for his position against the penalties on
farmers being administered through higher coresponsibility
levies.
    He said he believes increasing the levies would do nothing
to increase EC cereals consumption whereas lower prices for
farmers could help in this direction.

<AUTHOR>    BY CAL MANKOWSKI</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wall Street's biggest one-day drop since
1914 has revived a bitter debate about whether modern
investment techniques turn shifts in investor psychology into
colossal moves in share prices.
    ""The market has gotten away from the players,"" said Dudley
Eppel, vice president-equity trading at Donaldson Lufkin and
Jenrette Securities Corp. He says stock index futures and
options have distorted the investment process.
    But Wall Street professionals who work with index futures
and options insist the blame is misplaced.
    Fischer Black, head of the trading and arbitrage division
at Goldman, Sachs and Co, says so-called program trading
strategies involving opposite positions in futures on stock
indices and the underlying stocks deserve almost no blame for
today's decline. ""People have changed their minds about the
future of the economy,"" he said. Another strategy, known as
portfolio insurance, may have exagerated the decline to a small
degree, said Black.
    Eli Wachtel of Bear, Stearns and Co was emphatic. ""I do not
believe the drop was precipitated by portfolio insurance or
expanded by program trading.""
    ""The only thing that will stop it in the end is the value
investor who comes in and says 'IBM still sells computers', and
buys for traditional reasons"" said Jeffrey Miller of Miller
Tabak Hirsch and Co.
    IBM &lt;IBM> fell 31 to 104 as the Dow Jones Industrial
Average dropped more than 500 points.
    Several years ago Miller's firm was one of the first to
pursue program trading strategies, seeking to lock in an
automatic profit by taking advantage of discrepancies in the
prices of the futures and the underlying stocks. But he said
his firm has not been involved in that since late last year.
    Miller said some investors who were burned in the recent
market declines may have miscalculated the effects of portfolio
insurance. He estimated 70 to 80 billion dlrs in invested funds
prior to the decline were hedged with futures.
    The way portfolio insurance is used, Miller said, investors
at the time they protect their portfolios commit themselves to
a future course of action such as buying a put option. While
negative news such as trade deficits and budget deficits build
for months, the put options tend to be crowded into a narrow
span of time, because they are executed as the market starts to
fall.
    Miller said at present people can only guess how much
portfolio insurance is in use. He suggested some system of
disclosure could put other investors on guard that the seeds
were being planted that might add to a future decline.
    But in any case Miller argued that index futures and
options do not initiate market trends.
    People like Eppel of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette were
steadfast in their criticism. ""If I had my way there wouldn't
be any index futures,"" he said. ""They propelled the market up
when nothing was going on and now we're paying the price.""
    Another irate trader, referring to IBM's 31 point drop,
complained ""what announcement did IBM make over the weekend
that made its stock drop 31 points?"" IBM was as high as 175-7/8
earlier this year.
    Some economists agreed that the stock market could be
sending signals about the economy.  Allen Sinai, chief
economist for Shearson Lehman Brothers, told Reuters the 508
point decline represented ""a crisis of confidence.
    ""This is a a bona-fide financial crisis. The market is
showing panic. I suspect there is a wholesale deserting of our
markets by a lot of foreign investors.""
    Sinai said the crisis was caused by continuing U.S. budget
and trade deficits and by rising interest rates. ""This is not a
signal of the start of a recession, but a strong indicator that
one is coming if nothing is done in Washington to deal with the
budget and trade deficits,"" Sinai said.
    Some market participants said redemptions by investors who
own mutual funds fueled the decline. But Steve Norwitz, a
spokesman for T. Rowe Price Associates, a Baltimore-based
investment management firm, said redemptions and switches into
money market funds by Price's one mln accounts amounted to less
than two pct of assets. ""It's not a rout by any means.""
   
    Norwitz said the company normally receives about 3,500
telephone inquiries from its customers each day. On Friday, he
said, when the Dow index fell 108 points the volme of calls
rose to around 7,000 and today it exceeded that although he did
not have a precise number.
    Ike Kerridge, an economist with the oilfield service firm
Baker Hughes Inc., was one of several analysts who said the
evaporation of billions of dollars of paper profits could alter
consumer behavior.
    ""This could be the trigger for a national recession which
would be very unusual in an election year,"" Kerridge said.

<TITLE>BAKER/STOLTENBERG MEETING SOOTHES MARKETS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn and Anthony Williams</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the
dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.
    News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great
secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by
Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears
that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.
    The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two
pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.
    The announcement of the meeting, also attended by
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously
in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York
markets.
    Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies
accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry
spokesman in Bonn said.
    The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of
1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.
    The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market
reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest
rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that
West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.
    Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to
coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with
the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating
their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget
deficit.
    West German government sources said rising West German
money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre
pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest
rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising
since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed
raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.
    German yields have also risen over this period, but less
markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up
short-term rates by changing the terms on its security
repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the
money market.
    The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,
compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's
inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,
but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the
Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary
growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,
bank economists said.
    This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the
pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the
more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.
    In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,
the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this
morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.
anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.
    ""They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much
under American fire,"" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at
Swiss Bank Corp here.
    ""It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a
significant retreat from its position,"" added Giles Keating,
economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.
    The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of
the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact
on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market
economists said.
    Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank
does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation
rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,
little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.
    The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication
that the meeting would take place, although the Finance
Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.
    Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to
comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre
accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he
assumed monetary cooperation would continue.
    The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West
Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit
Denmark and Belgium.

<TITLE>EX-ARCO &lt;ARC> CHIEF SEES ENERGY CRISIS BY 1990</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dwindling global crude oil reserves and
the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send
the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic
Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.
    ""It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks,"" Anderson
told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. ""I
believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in
two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find.""
    Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil
and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln
barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about
4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.
    ""If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up
one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle
East,"" he said. ""We're soon going to be right back where we
were in 1973 and 1979.""
    Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at
about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.
    ""There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't
enough supply,"" he said. ""There have been no major oil
discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years.""
    Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world
discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of
oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.

<TITLE>ECONOMIST BATRA SEES NO REASON TO PANIC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Economist Ravi Batra, whose book warning
of a crash on Wall Street has been a best seller all summer,
said Monday's record-breaking market drop was no reason to
panic.
    ""I think (investors) should stay in the market. Don't
panic. The time to panic is two years from now,"" Batra, a
professor at Southern Methodist University, told Reuters by
telephone from Pittsburgh, where he was to deliver a lecture at
Rockwell International Corp.
    Batra's book, ""The Great Depression of 1990,"" predicts that
the increasing concentration of U.S. wealth will lead to a
depression.
     He said Monday's 508-point drop was set off by last week's
news of the trade deficit ""and other things that added to the
total jitters.""
     However, he called the fall a ""mini-crash,"" due in part to
a change in people's attitude to the market. ""In the 1920s,
people thought the market would never come down,"" he said, ""But
today, people think it will come down at some point, and
therefore when it does, everyone wants to get out.""
     ""It turns a mini-crash into a maxi-crash,"" he said, but
added that he did not see it falling any further.
     He said he expects the government to announce by the end
of the week an agreement with Japan and West Germany to bring
interest rates down.
     ""Once (interest rates) come down, the market will calm
down,"" he said, adding the government had other options, such
as acting on program trading, that it might be able to use to
stabilize the market.
     ""But in two year's time, the government will run out of
options,"" he added.

<TITLE>BRAZIL WILL LIFT MORATORIUM ONLY AFTER BANK PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil will only lift the partial
moratorium on its 113-billion-dlr foreign debt after an accord
is reached with the private banks, the Finance Ministry said in
a statement.
    The statement said such agreement, currently being
negotiated, must place the debt ""within the terms proposed by
Brazil on September 25.""
    Brazil proposed to the private creditors a refinancing of
the interest on its foreign debt that have expired or will
expire up to 1989, totalling an overall 10.4 billion dlrs.
    Brazil also proposed the end of spreads and conversion into
bonds of part of the 70-billion dlrs owed to private banks.
    Brazil in February stopped interest payments on about 68
billion dlrs owed to private banks, and the Ministry statement
issued on Monday said this would only be lifted ""when an accord
is reached.""
    The statement said that a token payment, which banks want
from the Brazil as a condition to discuss an agreement, ""will
only be made when there is a major progress in the
negotiations.""
    Meanwhile, a World Bank mission arrived on Monday to
analyse the performance of the Brazilian economy after the new

<TITLE>JAPAN TO KEEP BUYING U.S. REAL ESTATE ACTIVELY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Active Japanese investment in U.S. real
estate will continue despite a weak dollar because such
investments are strong hedges against inflation, financiers and
real estate industry experts said.
    Addressing a conference on Japanese investment in U.S. real
estate, Setsuya Tabuchi, chairman of Nomura Securities Co Ltd,
said Japanese investors are extremely cautious about investing
in Treasury securities because of currency losses suffered in
the past during the dollar's sharp decline.
    But, he added, ""Real estate is a hedge against inflation,
so such investment will not decline.""
    Japanese total investment in U.S. real estate last year is
estimated at around six billion dlrs, exceeding the four
billion dlrs ploughed into U.S. equities, Arther Mitchell of
Coudert Brothers, a U.S. law firm, told the conference.
    Adding in financing of real estate projects by Japanese
banks and leasing companies, the total aamount of Japanese
funds committed to U.S. real estate projects could reach 20
billion dlrs in 1987, he said.
   The dollar's fall has made U.S. property cheap, and exchange
risks are low because many Japanese firms are making
investments projected on a dollar/yen rate of 120-130, he said.
    Panelists at the conference said Japanese are now looking
at a wider variety of real estate investments, including
development projects and suburban buildings.
    Benjamin Lambert, chairman of Eastdil Realty Inc, said the
sale of 50 pct of the company to Nomura last year was designed
to expand its customer base to Japan through the securities
house's close ties with Japanese investors.
    Participation in mortgage loans is becoming popular among
Japanese, panelists said. Mortgages can be made to disguise
active purchases, and years later the loans can be converted
into ownership of the property, they said.

    U.N. press secretary Francois Giuliani said the Secretary
General had no comment on the attack, which followed his appeal

President Reagan for the U.S. strike against Iranian targets in
the Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congress
debate over limits on his powers to make war.
    The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships

Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on
a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.

    But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that

with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of
American forces from the waterway.

<TITLE>U.S. FDA LETS ICN &lt;ICN> RESUME TESTING AIDS DRUG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
has allowed ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc to resume testing its
ribavirin experimental AIDS drug, according to ICN.
    ""Our safety concerns are not of sufficient magnitude to
withhold approval of further clinical studies designed to
assess the safety and efficacy of ribavirin,"" the FDA told ICN
Chairman Milan Panic in an October 16 letter made public by
ICN.
    An FDA spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the letter.
    ICN's tests of the drug on humans were blocked last spring
after the FDA decided there was insufficient evidence of its
effectiveness against two common AIDS-related conditions.
    The tests had been intended to determine whether ribavirin
was effective against AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) and
Lymphadenopathy Syndrome or LAS.
    FDA Commissioner Frank Young disclosed in May, however,
that the agency was investigating ""suspicious"" test results
submitted by ICN on the antiviral drug. Young said he had
personally scolded ICN officials for making exaggerated claims
about the drug. In addition, a House subcommittee said it was
probing ICN for possible trading or financial irregularities.
    Today, the FDA said it was letting ICN test ribavirin for
safety and effectiveness in 32 patients with ARC and LAS.

<TITLE>PACIFIC EXCHANGE CLOSE BURIED IN UNFILLED ORDERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Pacific Stock Exchange closed
half an hour early under a pile of unfilled orders on heavy,
but not record, volume of over 11 mln shares, Exchange
officials said.
    As traders remained on the floors in San Francisco and Los
Angeles, madly trying to balance their accounts long after the
close, Exchange Chairman Maurice Menn told a news conference
trading will, nevertheless, begin on time tomorrow,
at 0630 Pacific Daylight Time.
    Menn told reporters the price of a seat on the exchange
dropped to 86,000 dlrs today from 100,100 dlrs a week ago.
    Menn said the day also saw 134,000 options contracts
traded, compared to a record 202,000 contracts last friday.
    Traders both in Los Angeles and San Francisco said volume
was curbed purely by their inability to fill orders and the
chaos created by the exchange tape falling hours behind, making
it nearly impossible to get accurate price readings.
    ""If we would have been able to execute the orders we got,
there would have been 20 mln shares traded,"" said Richard
Goforth, a partner with Crowell Weedon and Co, who trades on
the Los Angles floor of the Pacific Exchange.
    Traders in San Francisco said there were unconfirmed
reports that one brokerage house alone turned away orders for
50,000 shares they were unable to fill in late trading.
    The traders and exchange officials said action on the
Pacific Exchange did not deviate from that in New York, with
some early buying giving way to panic selling through the
close, which left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down a
record 508 points.
    ""We pretty much mirrored what was going on in New York...
they couldn't fill their orders and we knew we couldn't fill
them either,"" said Goforth.
    While traders said they are bracing themselves for a lower
opening tomorrow, Mann attributed today's dive to panicking
young traders and to monetary policy and said the market should
still recover.
    ""It depends on what the politicians do...There's no reason
it cannot go back. This is an abnormality and there is no
justification for this. People are nervous,"" he said.
    Mann noted he had never seen traders in San Francisco leave
on the floor so long after the close.
    In Los Angeles, one office manager commented early in the
day it was unusual to see traders on their feet.
    ""Usually, they're sitting down studying the market, but its
moving so fast they don't have a chance,"" he said.
    In San Francisco, about 50 people on the sidewalk outside
the jammed lobby of Charles Schwab and Co, strained to see the
discount brokerage house's large ticker display.
    ""I can't believe it,"" mumbled one onlooker.

recognizing the limited character of the American military
reaction to the attacks it has suffered in the past few days,""

events with caution.

<TITLE>US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A proposal to require imported
tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow
and possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.
    The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a
10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopes
the plan would be adopted this year.
    A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.
    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an
amendment to a farm spending reduction package.
    ""I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving
American consumers the information they need,"" he said.
    Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean
Association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils
are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.
    The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating
tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage
consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,
Indonesia and the Philippines.
    But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal
""blatantly discriminates"" against imports, would be impossible to
defend under international trade law and would harm relations
with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.
    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their
saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively
little from tropical oils.
    The committee voted largely along party lines, with three
Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.

<TITLE>DELORS CALLS FOR G-7 MEETING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community Commission
President Jacques Delors called for a swift convening of a
meeting of the G-7 countries following the instability in
today's trading on world money and stock markets.
    He told a press conference here: ""G-7 should meet discreetly
and quickly.""
    Delors said if the dollar were to fall further against the
mark to levels around 1.60, the European Monetary System would
undergo a ""test by fire.""
    Delors said the current problems in the markets had been
caused by excessive growth in financial trading, excessive
deregulation and the failure of the fundamentals of the world
economy to adapt themselves quickly enough to changing
circumstances.
    He said it was ""profoundly unjust"" to blame it on recent
increases in West Germany.

<TITLE>NYSE CHAIRMAN SAYS MARKET DECLINE NOT A CRASH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>New York Stock Exchange chairman John
Phelan said the stock market underwent a significant correction
today but he did not characterize it as a crash. He also said
the NYSE will open tomorrow on time.
    ""The market underwent a significant fall and a significant
devaluation of assets of which we are all concerned,"" he said.
    Speaking to reporters, Phelan listed several reasons why
the market fell today. He said stocks have been going up for
five years without a correction. He also blamed inflation
fears, rising interest rates, a lower dollar and problems with
Iran. ""All came together in a very nervous market"" he said.
    ""It's the nearest thing to a meltdown that I ever want to
see,"" Phelan said. Phelan said what he meant by meltdown was a
snowballing effect where selling fed on itself.
    Phelan said the NYSE is going through its standard
procedures before trading begins tomorrow. Those procedures
include checking with member firms on their liquidity, margin
positions, and backlog. ""We know of no firm that has a
significant problem, but that could change at any moment,"" he
said.
    Asked for advice for the average investor, Phelan said, ""We
do not know where the market will end up.""
    The Dow Jones Industrial average declined a record 508
points to 1738.74. Volume was a record setting 605 mln shares,
almost double the previous record.
    Phelan, in response to a question on declines in foreign
markets, said he believes there is no loss of confidence in the
global economy. He added that the underlying fundamentals of
the U.S. economy are still strong, and that corporate earnings
also continue to be firm.
    Phelan explained today's record descent as being the result
of a confluence of factors, including the globalization of
markets and the proliferation of new securities instruments.
    Those two factors alone have made the market more volatile,
he said.
    Phelan also said a major factor in the decline was the fact
that there has been no major correction in the five-year bull
market. He also pointed to rising tension in the Mideast Gulf.
    The New York Stock Exchange was in constant contact with
the Securities and Exchange Commission about a possible halt in
all trading on the exchange, Phelan said. ""The consensus was
that it is better to let the market try to work itself out,"" he
said.
    In addition, Phelan said that with the global nature of
trading there is no guarantee that halting trading on the New
York Stock Exchange would have served any purpose. Phelan said
he was in contact with the Treasury department, White House and
the Federal Reserve, but that the contact was made as a matter
of routine.

met West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl today in West Germany and
agreed to support the Louvre pact, the Treasury Department
said.
    The Treasury described the meeting as ""a very positive,
private meeting in Frankfurt, West Germany which had been
agreed upon last week. ""The parties agreed to continue economic
cooperation under the Louvre agreement and its flexible
application including cooperation on exchange rate stability

them to foster exchange rate stability around current levels.""
    The Louvre pact is an agreement between the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries including the United States and

<TITLE>REAGAN SAID CONVINCED ECONOMY STILL SOUND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan is concerned about
the record drop in stock prices but remains convinced on the
basis of administration talks with financial experts that the
economy remains sound, the White House said.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a written
statement that Reagan ""watched today with concern"" the decline on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average plunged
more than 500 points.
    The statement said Reagan had directed administration
officials to consult with leading financial experts, including
the chairmen of the Federal Reserve, the Securities and
Exchance Commission, and the New York Stock Exchange.
    ""These consultations confirm our view that the underlying
economy remains sound,"" Fitzwater said.
    The White House statement, issued about 45 minutes after
the stock market closed, appeared designed to calm investors
worried about U.S. economic propects.
    ""We are in the longest peacetime expansion in history.
Employment is at the highest level ever. Manufacturing output
is up. The trade deficit, when adjusted for changes in
currencies, is steadily improving. And, as the chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board has recently stated, there is no evidence
of a resurgence of inflation in the United States,"" Fitzwater
said.
   
    He said Reagan was keeping close watch on the markets in
the United States and in countries, where waves of selling
developed on Monday.
    ""We will continue to closely monitor these developments,""
Fitzwater said.
    However, his three-paragraph statement gave no hint of
what, if any, action Reagan might take if the stock market
plunge continues.
    The percentage drop of 22.6 percent on Monday was the
second largest ever, exceeded only by the 24.4 percent drop on
Dec. 12, 1914.
   
    It easily eclipsed the fall of 12.8 percent on Oct. 28,
1929 which helped spark the Great Depression.
    Reagan and his top advisers discussed the market crisis,
which came on the same day American naval forces retaliated for
last Friday's alleged Iranian missile attack on a U.S. flagged
Kuwaiti tanker in the Gulf, at a White House issues luncheon.
    Presidential aides told reporters after the luncheon an
official statement was likely to be issued when the markets
closed.

    Texaco said the experimental technique involves injecting

<TITLE>YUGOSLAV ECONOMIC PLAN SEEN FACING HURDLES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Andrej Gustincic</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yugoslavia's ambitious economic recovery
and anti-inflation plan faces major hurdles before it can be
implemented, Yugoslav economists and Western diplomats said.
    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic on Monday proposed new taxes
hitting high income earners, moonlighters, property and
interest on savings as part of new government plans to rein in
the country's 123 pct inflation.
    He also proposed price and wage restraint and the trimming
of repayments on the 20 billion dlr foreign debt in line with
currency earning abiltiy.
    ""The taxes will anger many Yugoslavs struggling with
soaring prices and will be resisted in Parliament,"" a Western
diplomatic source said. Yugoslav economists said Mikulic's
draft plans left many questions unanswered.
    ""It was a list of goals, not concrete measures,"" said a
senior Yugoslav economist at a leading Yugoslav research
institute.
    The state news agency Tanjug was more optimistic. It said
the proposals indicated ""real economic reforms"" were coming.
    Further details of the program, which Mikulic summarised in
Parliament, are to appear in the days ahead, and the draft has
to be debated and voted on by deputies in November.
    ""The goals are good,"" a leading Belgrade economist said.
""No one can argue with that. But the million dollar question,
as with all government programs here, is how they will be
implemented.""
    Zoran Popov, senior research fellow at The Belgrade
Institute for Industrial Economy said the existing system made
many of the proposals difficult to put into effect.
    ""A change in the the system of taxation requires changes in
the constitution,"" he said. ""Mikulic's speech tells us what he
wants to do, but not how.""
    ""It may be anti-inflationary,"" one diplomat said. ""But the
question is how can you tax a black economy and how will the
government find out who has two jobs or more than one home.""
    Economists and diplomats said the proposals could be
resisted by deputies from several of Yugoslavia's constituent
republics and provinces in defence of regional interests.
    Such resistance has blocked the nationwide implementation
of federal government economic policy on many past occasions.

Joint Chiefs of Staff, predicted Iran will retaliate for the
U.S. strike against its oil platform though he said Iranian
options were limited.
    ""They will be determined. They will not be easily deterred,
and let me stress for you that our commitment there is not
going to be risk free or casualty free.""
    He said the most likely Iranian response would involve
terrorism or the laying of mines.
    ""They obviously will look for ways that are probably more in
line with the 'silent hand' than what they have tried thus far,""
Crowe told an American Stock Exchange conference.
    He declined comment on a reporter's query whether he
favored a stronger move against Iran than that ordered by the
president.
    ""We carried out the operation that was decided upon and we
carried it out with enthusiasm and I think it was

affirmed at 100 mln dlrs of subordinated debt at B-plus and

    Goodwill remains a high part of total equity and capital

flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday.
    Referring to that attack, Howe added, ""I trust the Iranians
will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will
only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense.""
    At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of
European Community (EC) ministers, Howe was asked about
statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was
now involved in a full-scale war.
    ""It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified
for Iran to react in that way,"" he said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co
said it supported the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC)
plan to establish price ceilings for ATT long-distance services
as a replacement for current regulation.
    The company was responding to an FCC proposal of August 4
that price caps replace the current rate-of-return regulation,
which has been in place for the past 20 years.
   
    ATT said vigorous competition in the long-distance industry
has made obsolete rate-of-return, which stipulates that a
company can earn no more than a fixed rate -- currently 12.2
pct -- on its investment.
    The company termed the price cap a ""transitional step,"" and
said it hoped the FCC would support a program of regulatory
oversight, which would consist of a streamlined tariff process.

<TITLE>J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM> LOWERS LOAN-LOSS PROVISIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said
third-quarter net income rose 3.6 pct to 219.2 mln dlrs, from
211.5 mln a year earlier, partly because of reduced loan-loss
provisions and a lower income tax bill.
    For the first nine months of the year, however, Morgan
posted a loss of 140.8 mln dlrs, compared with a profit of
682.4 mln in the same period of 1986, because it set aside 875
mln dlrs in reserves in the second quarter against shaky
third-world loans.
    The provision for loan losses in the quarter was 20 mln
dlrs, down from 70 mln a year earlier.
    Morgan's tax bill was 52.4 mln dlrs in the quarter, down
from 85.3 mln a year earlier, mainly because of benefits
associated with the second-quarter loan-loss provision.
    Net interest earnings fell to 474.3 mln dlrs from 526.5 mln
as net yield narrowed to 2.71 pct from 3.13 pct and 1.3 billion
dlrs of Brazilian loans remained on non-accrual.
    Non-interest operating income was 296 mln dlrs, up from
292.8 mln. Net charge-offs halved to 16 mln dlrs.
    Expenses jumped 18 pct to 387.3 mln dlrs, with personnel
costs accounting for half of the increase. The effect of the

<TITLE>HUGE OIL PLATFORMS DOT GULF LIKE BEACONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By ASHRAF FOUAD</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like
beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.
    One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,
was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.
    The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and
concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60
metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.
Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.
    The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section
of the structure remained.
    U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an
American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.
forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had
been caught laying mines.
    But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense
officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm
missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday
and the Sea Isle City on Friday.
    Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a
key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.
    Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East
now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti
tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.
    But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level
of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result
of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.
    The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a
U.S. ""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said
Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.
    He said with this appraoch America would suffer ""the death
of one thousand cuts.""
    But for the United States to grab the initiative
militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's
harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its
shipping must pass, Schuler said.
    He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing
Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,
Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.
    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic
initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an
arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.
    He said the United States should also threaten to mine and
blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to
acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a
settlement.
    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by
invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the
outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style
infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.
    Each side has attacked the others' shipping.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> CANADA UNIT MAJOR OFFER ACCEPTED BY UNION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian Auto Workers' Union said it
accepted an economic offer from the Canadian division of
General Motors Corp &lt;GM> in contract negotiations.
    But union president Bob White said many local issues at the
11 plants in Ontario and Quebec still remained unresolved ahead
of Thursday's deadline for a strike by 40,000 workers.
    ""It minimizes the possibility of a strike,"" White told
reporters.
    However, ""if we don't have local agreements settled by
Thursday, there will be a strike,"" he said.
    The local issues still unresolved involved health care,
skilled trades and job classifications, White said.
    GM Canada negotiator Rick Curd said he believed a strike
would be avoided.
    ""Even though there are some tough issues to be resolved
we're on the right schedule to meet the target,"" Curd said.
    ""I'm very pleased with the state of the negotiations,"" he
said.
    Union membership meetings have been scheduled for the
weekend in case a tentative settlement, said White.
    White said the union has also received assurances that a
job protection pact negotiated with GM workers in the U.S. does
not threaten Canadian jobs.
    The economic offer for a three-year pact largely matches
agreements at Ford &lt;F> and Chrysler &lt;C> in Canada, which
include inflation-indexed payments for future retirees and
fixed annual payments for current retirees.
    It also gives workers wage increases of three pct

<TITLE>DIPLOMATS CALL U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG RESTRAINED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ian MacKenzie</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform
in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid
carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab
allies, Western diplomats in the region said.
    U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that
U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf
in response to a missile strike on the American-registered
Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
    ""We consider the matter closed,"" he said, a signal the U.S.
administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.
    Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day
against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action
would endanger American interests.
    Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War
Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a
""crushing blow.""
    ""The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in
no way get out safely,"" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.
    Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid
ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on
November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.
    Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in
Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in
preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.
    Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab
states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they
said.
    ""The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to
respond one way or the other,"" a diplomat said.
    President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American
countermeasures if the military escalation continued.
    Western diplomats and military sources in the area said
shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act
the United States could have taken once it had decided to
retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans
and Kuwaitis on Iran.
    ""It's interesting that they chose something in international
waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation,"" one
diplomat said. ""This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf
Arab states, particularly Kuwait.""
    Commented another diplomat: ""Kuwait must be happy that the
U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked
on its doorstep.""
    One source said of the attack on the oil platform: ""They
managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the
least nuisance to everybody.""
    A diplomat commented: ""They were very clever in the place
they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated
anything because it wasn't working in the first place.""
    A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:
""This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up
... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans).""

<TITLE>LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By CHRISTOPHER HANSON</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Military experts say the United States
faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an
Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a
U.S.-flagged tanker.
    The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is
likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as
long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching
limited retaliatory strikes.
    But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps
-- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or
destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.
    ""Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the
cycle of attack and retaliation continues,"" said Fred Axelgard,
a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS).
    ""It's like a Greek tragedy,"" said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll
of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)
think tank.
    Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for
Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to
the war between Iran and Iraq.
    They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its
30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began
escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal 
would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which
President Reagan could never accept.
    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon
news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel
fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam
oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf
time (0700 EDT) on Monday.
    Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military
base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian
Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea
Isle City on Friday.
    Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and
allowed to escape.
    ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will
be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran
with stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said.
    ""We consider this matter closed,"" he said.
    Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives
agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not
escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was
whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken
this view after earlier clashes.

<TITLE>GOLDMAN MAY LEND A BILLION DLRS TO MUTUAL FUNDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Goldman Sachs and Co has decided to make
a billion dlrs of its own capital available to mutual funds to
enable them to sell securities for cash if they need to do so,
a senior spokesman for the investment banking firm said.
    The spokesman said Goldman took the decision on its own
initiative on Tuesday morning after a number of mutual funds
had reported a cash squeeze because of a flood of redemptions
by stock market investors.
    The New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange
Commission were informed of the move, he said.
    The spokesman described the action as an effort to be
helpful. ""We're not trying to encourage them to liquidate, but
if it's needed, the money's there,"" he said.
    The provision of one billion dlrs poses no undue burden on
Goldman Sachs's capital, the spokesman said.

<DATELINE>    HARTFORD, Conn., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Northeast Savings F.A. said its
board adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to protect the
company from coercive takeover tactics and bids not fair to all
sharholders.
    Under the plan, the board declared a dividend of one share
purchase right for each of the Northeast common shares held of
record as of November two, the company said.
    Initially, the rights are not exerciseable, rights
certificates are not distributed, and the rights automatically
trade with Northeast's shares, the company said.
    However, 20 days following the acquisition of 20 pct or
more of Northeast's common shares shares or 20 days following
the commencement of a tender offer for 30 pct or more of
Northeast's shares, the rights will become exerciseable and
separate rights certificates will be distributed, the company
said.
    The rights will entitle holders of Northeast's common
shares to purchase additional shares at an exercise price of 60
dlrs a share, the company said.
    The company said that in the event of certain triggering
events described in the rights plan, holders of the rights,
other than an acquiring person, will be entitled to acquire
Northeast's common shares having a market value of twice the
then-current exercise price of the rights. Also, in the event
Northeast enters into certain business combination
transactions, holders of the rights will be provided a right to
acquire equity securities of the acquiring entity having a
market value of twice the then-current exercise price of the
rights, the company said. Northeast said it will be entitled to
redeem the rights at one cent per right until the occurence of
certain events.

<TITLE>U.S. DRAFTS SANCTIONS IN ARGENTINA SOY CASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. is drafting options including
possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over
the differential between soybean and product  taxes which
Buenos Aires levies on exports.
    The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure
of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed
by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S.
officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential
export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in
competition with the U.S.
    ""Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict
(Argentine) access to our market,"" said one U.S. source.
   
    The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to
end the differential.
    But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88
year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.
    Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture
minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille
on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not
narrow the differential further for 1987/88.
    As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering
restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef
and finished leather, the U.S. sources said.
    A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reagan
administration soon, they said.

<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The African Development Bank plans to
raise about 200 mln dlrs via a U.S. Domestic bond this year,
Milan Kerno, vice president of finance said at a presentation.
    He said the Bank planned to borrow about 700 mln dlrs in
world capital markets in 1987 and roughly the same amount in
1988. Because of the weak condition of the euroyen market,
plans for a bond in that sector, which would comprise part of
the 700 mln dlrs,  have been put on hold, Kerno said.
    ""But we should complete our programme (this year), markets
willing,"" Kerno said, adding the Bank's 1987 borrowing so far
totaled about 400 mln dlrs.
    The Bank's board of directors will meet on October 26 to
discuss plans to begin Bank trading in unspecified securities,
with desks in Abidjan, Kerno said.
    Trading would be conducted along similar lines as existing
World Bank and Asian Development Bank operations, he said.
    The Bank now has roughly 1.2 billion dlrs in available
liquidity to serve as a basis for trading, although not all of
this will be traded at the start. The Bank plans to use the
funds gradually over the next three or four years, he said.
    To facilitate lending increases the Bank tripled paid-in
capital to about 18 billion dlrs from six billion in June.
    German bankers at the presentation criticized the Bank for
its overly conservative lending, adding the Bank would do
better to invest more capital in loans. Total net equity
capital, consisting of subscribed capital and reserves, rose to
1,282 pct of its funded debt in 1986 from 552 pct in 1985, the
Bank's statistics showed.
    Other Bank figures from 1986 showed the Interamerican
Development Bank's net equity totaled 302 pct of funded debt,

<TITLE>YUGOSLAVIA DEBT PAYMENTS TO BE ADJUSTED TO EXPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yugoslav Prime Minister Branko Mikulic,
unveiling a new draft economic program, said Yugoslavia would
cut repayments on its almost 20 billion lr hard currency debt
to bring them in line with its hard currency earning capacity.
    ""We have decided to coordinate repayment of our debt with
realistically assessed capabilities of our economy,"" he said in
Parliament. He said the current debt-service ratio (over 40 pct
of export revenue) was too high.
    Yugoslavia is to negotiate a long-term restructuring of its
debt after missing repayments in recent months, Mikulic said.
    ""If we did not change the dynamics of repaying our debt, the
situation would become increasingly worse,"" Mikulic said.
    He said on the present repayment schedule, Yugoslavia would
have a net outflow of two billion dlrs and the level of debt
would be halved by 1995. But he added:
    ""The consequences would not only mean slower economic growth
in the coming years but also further exhaustion of the economy
and lasting damage to the economy's capacity for development,""
he said.
    ""All that would, of course, intensify social difficulties,""
Mikulic added.
    The state news agency Tanjug said on October 9 that
Yugoslavia plans to adjust debt repayments over the next eight
years and to cut the debt-service ratio to 25 pct.
    Yugoslavia failed to make a principal repayment due last
month which had already been postponed by 90 days.
    Mikulic's proposed economic program, which also includes
higher personal taxes as well as wage and price restraint, is
intended to serve as a basis for the debt talks to demonstrate
Yugoslavia's ability to eventually repay the credits.
    His program has to be discussed and approved by parliament
by early November.
    Mikulic said foreign debt should be retained at about the
same level as now until 1990 and the country should then be
able to keep currency reserves equal to three months payments.
    ""Of course, these are our proposals for talks with
creditors. We expect understanding and support because it is in
their interest as well,"" Mikulic said.
    He said that under the present schedule debt payments had
slowed economic development and exhausted currency reserves.
Banking sources say Yugoslavia's reserves are inadequate at
present for even one month's debt and import bill.

<TITLE>SOVIET 1988 GRAIN TARGET INDICATES 1987 OUTPUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Recent announcements from Moscow of
next year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets
are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,
Agriculture Department analysts said.
    USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but
some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987
grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.
    Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,
putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of
Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in
Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be
""25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.""
    ""This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213
mln tonne (grain) crop,"" the analyst said.
   
    In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235
mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure
published in a Soviet economic journal this month.
    USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a
range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.
    Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest
progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.
    While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture
official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be
as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.
    A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln
tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would
bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.

<TITLE>AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ian Jones</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on
world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains
that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the
Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.
    December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before
falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.
    ""Fundamentals are awful,"" said Philip Lambert, analyst with
stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC
production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln
bpd, little changed from September levels.
    Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC
production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and
International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September
production at 18.5 mln bpd.
    The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of
a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea
Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,
in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag
commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.
    The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the
area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.
    Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on
Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.
Attack, analysts said.
    They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which
around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in
the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.
    Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in
the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf
hostilities, analysts said.
    But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian
missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.
    Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,
said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.
    ""The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond
to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any
further action will be met with a like-for-like response.
Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,"" Pyne said.
    Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was ""a
responsible retaliation,"" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to
Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran
chose to raise the level of conflict.
    Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.
    He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as
Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests
the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a
result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian
retaliation.
    The initial upward market move this morning reflected a
strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which
was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile
launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.
    The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy
attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary
Caspar Weinburger.
    Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the
Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less
serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,
analysts and traders said.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand said
there was no evidence to suggest the fall in share prices had
affected financial stability and it would maintain its firm
monetary policy.
    Governor Spencer Russell said in a statement the central
bank did not accept arguments that the battle against inflation
should now take a low second priority after the sharemarket's
plunge.
    Russell said the bank had two statutory responsibilities --
to implement the government's monetary policy to bring down
inflation, and to ensure the financial sector's stability.
    ""Unless the bank is directed otherwise, the firm monetary
policy will continue because it is very much in the national
interest that it do so,"" he said.
    ""And there is yet no evidence available to the bank to
suggest that the fall in share prices has affected the
stability of the financial sector.""
    The Barclays share index fell a record 504.75 points to
2,925,26 on Tuesday, a decline of 14.7 pct.

<DATELINE>    PEORIA, Ill, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Caterpillar Inc said it expects 1987
full year sales and profits to be ""substantially better"" than
1986 results, following improved third-quarter performance.
    Third-quarter earnings of the heavy machinery manufacturer
increased to 146 mln dlrs, or 1.47 dlrs a share, from net loss
of 26 mln dlrs, or 26 cts, in the 1986 quarter. Sales rose to
2.25 billion dlrs from 1.82 billion dlrs last year.
    A weaker U.S. dollar strengthened Caterpillar's position
against foreign manufacturers and permitted price increases and
boosted sales, while a cost-cutting program lowered costs
significantly, the company said of third-quarter results.
   
    Continuation of the cost-reduction program, which is to
pare costs by 15 to 20 pct from 1986 to 1990, and a further
anticipated improvement in its price competitiveness are
expected to contribute to higher full year 1987 profits,
Caterpillar said.
    In 1986, the company earned 76 mln dlrs or 77 cents a

<TITLE>SWISS PLAN CHANGE IN LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BERNE, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Swiss Banking Commission hopes to
introduce a major reform of the banking system in January which
would revolutionise the workings of the country's unusual
liquidity requirements.
    Commission Director Kurt Hauri told Reuters the main
consequence of the change would be an end to the sharp rise in
interest rates which occurs at the end of every month.
    By effectively reducing liquidity requirements, it would
also help Swiss banks compete better against those in Britain,
West Germany and the United States, he said.
    The commission wants to move to a system of average
liquidity requirements, where banks have to hold reserves
equivalent to a certain proportion of their exposure calculated
over the month as a whole.
    The current system, described  as a Swiss special case by
Hauri, forces banks to comply with requirements generally only
at the end of each month.
    The result is a sharp upward trend in short dated money
market rates, overshadowed by the approach of the end-month,
called the ultimo, with consequent high costs for the banks who
are forced to borrow extra funds from the National Bank.
    This was particularly pronounced in June 1986 when
overnight rates hit triple figures, due to a combination of the
half-year end and a rigid adherence by the National Bank to its
money supply target. Although the rise shocked the bank into
more flexibility, the problem remained.
    The reform proposal, which Hauri said had been planned for
years, was given to banks and other interested parties for
comment on September 30.
    They have until the end of this month to suggest
alterations. Subject to such changes, and to the government
go-ahead, it will come into force on January 1, Hauri said.

that Northrop Corp &lt;NOC> must pay 31 mln dlrs to a company
controlled by Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi.
    The court denied a Northrop appeal challenging a U.S.
arbitration tribunal's ruling that it pay 31 mln dlrs in
commissions and interest stemming from arms contracts it won
from Saudi Arabia in the early 1970s.
    Northrop, seeking to sell F-5 fighter aircraft and
supporting services to Saudi Arabia, hired Khashoggi's firm in
1970 as its marketing representative.
    Northrop paid more than 17 mln dlrs in commissions to
Khashoggi's firm, Triad International Marketing, from 1971 to
1975. U.S. Defense Department records showed that Northrops'
sales to Saudi Arabia during this period totaled 4.2 billion
dlrs.
    The legal battle dates back to 1979, when Khashoggi began
arbitration proceedings seeking payment of more than 150 mln
dlrs in commissions due under his agreement with Northrop.
    A federal judge in 1984 threw out the arbitration panel's
award of 31 mln dlrs to Khashoggi's firm, but a U.S. Court of

issue a joint statement on the U.S. Attack on Iran for now,
diplomats said.
    They said the latest events in the Gulf were discussed only
briefly by foreign ministers over lunch, though member states
had been informed by Washington that it was planning military
action. ""They didn't have enough information to discuss it fully
and they wouldn't have agreed anyway,"" one diplomat said.
    Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans said Belgium had
always opposed an extension of violence in the Gulf and deeply
regretted that the situation had deteriorated.
    But British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said the
United States was fully entitled to take military action and
Francisco Fernandez Ordonez of Spain said the U.S. Strike could
be considered an af self-defence.

<DATELINE>    DALLAS, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman
William Seidman said he is worried that consumer confidence
will be undermined by panic selling of stocks.
    ""The principal worry is that the market will panic and
destroy the really strong confidence that the consumer has in
the economy,"" Seidman told reporters during the American
Bankers Association annual convention.
    But Seidman was relaxed about the implications for banks.
""I don't see any near-term effect on the banking system. We
would have to worry if it throws the economy into a major
recession. We don't expect that to happen."" he said.
    First Chicago Corp chairman Barry Sullivan echoed Seidman,
saying that the slump in stocks could hasten a recession ""if it
significantly impacts consumer confidence.""
    But Sullivan told reporters that he thinks the U.S. economy
remains sound.
    Sullivan said the slide in stocks was an extreme reaction
to recent increases in interest rates.
    Asked whether First Chicago would follow Chemical Bank in
raising its prime rate to 9-3/4 pct from 9-1/4, Sullivan said,
""We're looking very carefully at the money markets.""
    The FDIC's Seidman, asked whether the stock market rout was
a reason to reconsider plans to give broader securities powers
to commercial s, said, ""Under the plan we are suggesting
that (securities) activities be done in subsidiaries so if ever
things go badly for them it won't affect their capital.""

    Individual investments are expected to range between one

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>International monetary officials will 
rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the
Louvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar
free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets,
economists and currency traders said.
    ""I don't think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks up
in an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of the
dollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets.
It's in the Group of Seven's interest to calm things down,""
said Douglas Madison, corporate trader at BankAmerica Corp.
   
    In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretary
James Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German
money market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to
foster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed.
    His comments rocked the currency markets and helped send
the already-fragile U.S. and overseas stock markets into a
tailspin.
    The dollar lost more than two pfennigs in the U.S. to about
1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35 yen. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points at one

swap value at 115 mln dlrs, based on October 16 closing prices.
    The company said the agreement calls for the holders of
common stock in Hal Roach to exchange their shares on a
one-for-one basis for shares in the combined company.
    It said holders of Robert Halmi common will exchange their
shares on a two-and-one-half-for-one basis for shares in the
combined company.
    The company said the swap will be tax-free.
    The company also said &lt;Qintex Ltd>, a 35 pct owner of Hal
Roach common stock, has agreed to use the company as the
exclusive vehicle for its U.S. media and entertainment
investments, the company said.
    The company said Qintex's U.S. subsidiary also agreed to
supply a minimum 70 mln dlrs line of credit to the new company,
which shall be used, with Qintex approval, for financing new
HRI products.
    The company said that under the definitive agreement,
Qintex's U.S. division will have the right to purchase up to 51
pct of the new company in the open market, in private
transactions or by tender offer, but will not be purchasing
warrants to bring its ownership to 51 pct of the new company.
    If Qintex's U.S. subsidiary has not achieved this ownership
within one year after the completion of the merger, the
subsidiary will have the right two years thereafter to request
that HRI commence a rights offering to HRI stockholders, the
company said.
    Regarding the potential rights offering, Qintex's U.S.
subsidiary will act as standby purchaser, the company said.
    The transaction is subject to the approval of both
company's shareholders, the receipt of certain tax approvals,
and the continued employement of Robert Halmi Sr and Robert
Halmi Jr, the company said.
    Robert Halmi Sr, who is currently chairman and chief
executive officer of Robert Halmi Inc, will be chairman of the
new company and David Evans, current president and chief
operating officer of Hal Roach, will become chief executive,
the company said.
